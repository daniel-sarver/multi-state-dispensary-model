# Codex Review - Phase 3b Fixes & Population Density Analysis

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Commit**: 4a4506a
**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved

## Codex Review Findings - All Addressed

### Issue 1: Missing Dependencies in requirements.txt ✅

**Problem**: Phase 3 dependencies were commented out, fresh environment would fail

**Fix**:
- Uncommented: `scikit-learn>=1.3.0`, `statsmodels>=0.14.0`, `matplotlib>=3.7.0`, `seaborn>=0.12.0`, `scipy>=1.11.0`
- Added: `geopy>=2.4.0` (used in competitive_features.py)

**File**: `requirements.txt:28-33`

---

### Issue 2: Data Leakage in Cross-Validation ✅ (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: StandardScaler fitted on full training set before CV, causing data leakage
- Each CV fold's validation data influenced scaler statistics
- Artificially inflated CV R² estimates

**Fix**: Implemented Pipeline for proper CV
```python
# OLD (leakage):
scaler.fit(X_train)  # Fits on ALL training data
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
cross_validate(model, X_train_scaled, ...)  # Validation data already saw scaler

# NEW (correct):
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),  # Fits separately on each CV fold
    ('ridge', Ridge(alpha=1000))
])
cross_validate(pipeline, X_train, ...)  # Each fold gets own scaler
```

**Impact**:
- CV R² remains strong: **0.1872 ± 0.0645** (still exceeds 0.15 target)
- Now truly independent estimate
- Test set evaluation improved (pipeline handles scaling internally)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/modeling/prepare_training_data.py:390-492` - Returns unscaled training data, adds `scale_test_only()` method
- `src/modeling/train_multi_state_model.py:76-157` - Implements Pipeline for Ridge training
- `src/modeling/train_multi_state_model.py:388-407` - Pipeline for LOSO validation

---

### Issue 3: Fragile State Label Extraction ✅

**Problem**: Used `X_test['is_FL'] > 0.5` to identify FL/PA samples
- Would silently fail if FL ever exceeded ~80% of sample (scaled value drops below 0.5)
- Relied on scaled features instead of original labels

**Fix**: Extract original state labels from training_df
```python
# OLD (fragile):
fl_mask = X_test['is_FL'] > 0.5  # Breaks with class imbalance

# NEW (robust):
training_df = self.prepared_data['training_df']
test_states = training_df.loc[X_test.index, 'state']
fl_mask = test_states == 'FL'
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/modeling/train_multi_state_model.py:299-304` - State-specific performance analysis
- `src/modeling/train_multi_state_model.py:374-381` - LOSO validation
- `src/modeling/prepare_training_data.py:466` - Added `training_df` to output dict

---

### Issue 4: Noisy Imputation of 100% Null Columns ✅

**Problem**: Imputation loop attempted to impute 100% null columns with NaN
- Triggered "2964 NaN values remain" warning every run
- Polluted VIF analysis logs

**Fix**: Skip 100% null columns in imputation loop
```python
for feature in numeric_cols:
    missing_count = self.training_df[feature].isna().sum()

    # Skip 100% null columns (will be dropped in feature selection)
    if missing_count == len(self.training_df):
        continue
```

**File**: `src/modeling/prepare_training_data.py:107-108`

## Population Density Analysis - Key Findings

### Research Questions

1. **Is there a non-linear (optimal range) relationship?**
2. **Is population_density confounded by competitor counts?**

### Methodology

Created `analyze_population_density.py` with 4 tests:

1. **Correlation Analysis** - Check relationships with other features
2. **Non-Linear Test** - Compare linear vs quadratic models
3. **Confounding Test** - Model pop_density with/without competitors
4. **Binned Analysis** - Visualize relationship across density quintiles

### Results

#### 1. Correlation Analysis

| Feature | Correlation with pop_density |
|---------|------------------------------|
| pop_5mi | +0.668 (strong) |
| pop_20mi | +0.619 (strong) |
| competitors_5mi | +0.459 (moderate) |
| visits | **-0.272 (negative)** |
| saturation_5mi | -0.269 |

**Finding**: Moderate correlation with competitors (0.459), not strong enough to fully explain negative effect.

#### 2. Non-Linear Relationship Test

- **Linear Model R²**: 0.0496
- **Quadratic Model R²**: 0.0489 (worse!)
- **R² Improvement**: -0.0006 (-1.3%)

**Finding**: ❌ **No evidence of optimal density range**. Relationship is monotonically negative (linear), not U-shaped.

#### 3. Competitor Confounding Test

| Model | R² | pop_density coefficient |
|-------|-----|------------------------|
| Pop Density Only | 0.0496 | **-5,000** |
| Pop Density + Competitors | 0.1078 | **-3,681** (26% reduction) |
| Competitors Only | 0.0893 | N/A |

**Finding**: ✅ **Competitors explain only 26% of pop_density's negative effect**. 74% remains unexplained!

#### 4. Binned Analysis

| Density Bin | Avg Density | Avg Visits | Avg Competitors (5mi) |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Very Low | 189 | **102,259** | 1.9 |
| Low | 967 | 72,854 | 4.2 |
| Medium | 2,055 | 62,145 | 5.6 |
| High | 3,409 | 62,247 | 7.6 |
| Very High | 6,329 | **55,616** | 8.4 |

**Finding**:
- Visits drop 46% from lowest to highest density
- Competitors increase 4.4x (1.9 → 8.4)
- **But visits decline even controlling for competition!**

### Conclusions

#### Question 1: Non-Linear Relationship?

**Answer**: ❌ **No optimal range exists**

- Quadratic model performs worse than linear
- Relationship is monotonically negative (more density → fewer visits)
- No evidence of "sweet spot" density range

#### Question 2: Competitor Confounding?

**Answer**: ⚠️ **Partial - Only 26% Explained by Competition**

- Competitors reduce pop_density coefficient by 26% (-5,000 → -3,681)
- But **74% of negative effect remains** even with competitors in model
- Population density has **independent negative effect** beyond competition

### Other Factors Explaining the Paradox

Since competition explains only 26%, what else causes the negative effect?

1. **Parking Constraints**
   - Dense urban cores have limited/expensive parking
   - Reduces customer accessibility vs suburban strip malls

2. **Demographic Differences**
   - Urban vs suburban customer preferences differ
   - Income, age, consumption patterns vary by density

3. **Market Saturation (Beyond Dispensaries)**
   - Dense areas have more retail competition generally
   - More entertainment/dining substitutes for discretionary spending

4. **Accessibility Issues**
   - Dense areas: traffic congestion, public transit reliance
   - Suburban areas: car-centric, easier access

5. **Regulatory Environment**
   - Zoning restrictions may differ by density tier
   - Operating hours, signage restrictions in urban cores

### Business Implications

✅ **Suburban locations genuinely outperform dense urban cores**, independent of dispensary competition.

**Recommendations**:

1. **Prioritize suburban locations** (1,000-3,000 people/sq mi)
   - Average 62,000-72,000 visits (middle density bins)
   - Lower competition (4-6 competitors within 5mi)
   - Better parking and accessibility

2. **Avoid very high density** (>5,000 people/sq mi)
   - Average only 55,616 visits despite 6.3x more population
   - 8.4 competitors within 5mi (market saturation)
   - Parking and accessibility challenges

3. **Rural locations can work** (<500 people/sq mi)
   - Highest average visits (102,259) despite low population
   - First-mover advantage (1.9 competitors)
   - Large geographic catchment compensates for low density

4. **Focus on competition metrics** over raw population
   - `competitors_5mi` and `saturation_5mi` are better predictors than `population_density`
   - But recognize population density has independent negative effect

## Validation of Model Performance

### Cross-Validation (Proper Pipeline)

After fixing data leakage, model still achieves:

- **CV R² = 0.1872 ± 0.0645** ✅ (Target: 0.15)
- **2.61x improvement** over baseline (0.0716)
- Training R² = 0.2371 (reasonable gap indicates good regularization)

**Conclusion**: Model performance robust even with proper CV methodology.
