# Codex Review - Phase 6 Fixes Complete

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Review Phase**: Pre-Training Phase 6
**Status**: ‚úÖ All Issues Resolved

## üîç Codex Findings & Resolutions

### Finding 1: Data Leakage - `corrected_visits_step1` in Feature Set

**Issue**:
- Column `corrected_visits_step1` (intermediate Placer correction before temporal adjustment) was not excluded from features
- This creates massive data leakage as it's nearly identical to the target variable
- Would artificially inflate R¬≤ and make model useless for real predictions

**Root Cause**:
- Exclusion patterns in `prepare_training_data.py:239` didn't catch this column
- Only excluded `corrected_visits_per_sq_ft` but not `corrected_visits_step1`

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ
- Added `'corrected_visits_step1'` to exclusion patterns
- Verified all leakage columns now excluded:
  - ‚úÖ `corrected_visits_step1` (intermediate step)
  - ‚úÖ `corrected_visits_per_sq_ft` (derived metric)
  - ‚úÖ `visits` (uncorrected legacy)
  - ‚úÖ `visits_per_sq_ft` (uncorrected legacy)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/modeling/prepare_training_data.py` (line 233)

**Verification**:
```
Data Leakage Check:
  ‚úÖ corrected_visits_step1 excluded (safe)
  ‚úÖ corrected_visits_per_sq_ft excluded (safe)
  ‚úÖ visits excluded (safe)
  ‚úÖ visits_per_sq_ft excluded (safe)

Total features selected: 44
```

### Finding 2: Documentation Mismatch (17 vs 15)

**Issue**:
- Documentation claimed 17 FL sites received temporal adjustments
- Actual dataset shows only 15 sites with `temporal_adjustment_applied=True`
- Counts throughout Phase 5B docs needed correction

**Root Cause**:
- Documentation written during implementation before final data export
- 2 sites likely filtered during final validation/deduplication
- Final dataset is correct (15 sites)

**The 15 Sites** (Verified):
1. Cannabist (Mint Cannabis) - Bonita Springs (2.6 months, 0.40 factor)
2. Curaleaf - St. Augustine (3.1 months, 0.50 factor)
3. Ayr Wellness - Orlando (4.0 months, 0.60 factor)
4. Cannabist (Mint Cannabis) - Miami (4.7 months, 0.60 factor)
5. Cookies Dispensary - Orlando (6.3 months, 0.75 factor)
6. Trulieve - St. Petersburg (6.5 months, 0.75 factor)
7. Trulieve - Miami (7.5 months, 0.80 factor)
8. Sanctuary Cannabis - Tampa (8.6 months, 0.85 factor)
9. FLUENT Cannabis Care - Miami (8.8 months, 0.85 factor)
10. Trulieve - Palm Coast (9.3 months, 0.90 factor)
11. Trulieve - Tampa (10.7 months, 0.95 factor)
12. Trulieve - Jacksonville (11.1 months, 0.98 factor)
13. Trulieve - Dania Beach (11.4 months, 0.98 factor)
14. Trulieve - Spring Hill (11.4 months, 0.98 factor)
15. Cannabist (Sunburn) - Cape Coral (11.4 months, 0.98 factor)

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ
Updated all references from 17 to 15 in:
- `docs/PHASE5B_CORRECTIONS_COMPLETE.md` (8 occurrences)
- `docs/CONTINUATION_PROMPT_PHASE6.md` (3 occurrences)

**Specific Changes**:
- Executive summary: "17 dispensaries" ‚Üí "15 dispensaries"
- Match statistics: "17 of 53" ‚Üí "15 of 53" (32% ‚Üí 28% match rate)
- Impact section: "17 FL dispensaries" ‚Üí "15 FL dispensaries" (2.9% ‚Üí 2.5%)
- Breakdown table: FL <12 months count and ‚â•12 months count adjusted
- Key columns description: "(17 FL sites)" ‚Üí "(15 FL sites)"
- Achievement checklist: "Matched 17 FL sites" ‚Üí "Matched 15 FL sites"
- Data quality notes: Match statistics corrected

## üìä Corrected Statistics Summary

| Metric | Old (Incorrect) | New (Correct) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| FL sites with temporal adjustment | 17 | 15 |
| Match rate (FL openings to training) | 32% (17/53) | 28% (15/53) |
| % of FL training sites adjusted | 2.9% (17/590) | 2.5% (15/590) |
| FL sites ‚â•12 months | 573 | 575 |

All other metrics remain unchanged:
- Total training sites: 741 ‚úì
- FL training sites: 590 ‚úì
- PA training sites: 151 ‚úì
- Average months operational: 7.8 ‚úì
- Placer correction factor: 0.5451 ‚úì

## ‚úÖ Pre-Training Checklist

Before proceeding with model v2 training:

- [x] **Data Leakage**: All target-related columns excluded from features
- [x] **Documentation**: Counts accurate and consistent (15 sites)
- [x] **Dataset**: `combined_with_competitive_features_corrected.csv` ready
- [x] **Target**: `corrected_visits` configured as target
- [x] **Exclusions**: All legacy/intermediate columns excluded
- [x] **Units**: Annual visits consistently labeled
- [x] **Code**: Training scripts updated for v2
- [x] **CLI**: Output labels updated to "Annual Visits"

## üéØ Impact Assessment

### Critical Issues Prevented

**Data Leakage Fix**:
- Would have caused artificially high R¬≤ (likely 0.95+)
- Model would have been useless for real predictions
- Would have wasted training time and led to false confidence
- **Estimated time saved**: 2-3 hours of debugging why "perfect" model fails in production

**Documentation Accuracy**:
- Prevents confusion in future analysis
- Ensures reproducibility
- Maintains trust in documented methodology

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify exclusion lists** against actual dataset columns
2. **Final documentation pass** should occur after data export, not during
3. **Automated checks** for target leakage should be standard practice
4. **Codex reviews** are invaluable for catching subtle issues before training

## üöÄ Ready for Phase 6 Training

All pre-training issues resolved. Safe to proceed with:
1. Training model v2 with corrected data
2. Updating predictor.py for v2
3. Performance comparison v1 vs v2
4. Final Phase 6 documentation

**Status**: ‚úÖ READY TO TRAIN

*Fixed issues identified in Codex review prior to Phase 6 model v2 training.*
