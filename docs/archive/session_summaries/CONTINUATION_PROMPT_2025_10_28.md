## Quick Copy/Paste Prompt

```
Continue work on Multi-State Dispensary Model.

Project Directory: /Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model

Recent completion (Oct 28, 2025):
- ✅ Fixed missing census tract issue (on-the-fly fetching from Census API)
- ✅ Implemented extreme value warning system with user approval
- ✅ Safe None value handling for incomplete Census data
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to git

Current Status:
- Model v2 trained and deployed (R² = 0.1812, 2.53x improvement)
- CLI fully functional with coordinate-based input
- Multi-site analysis and report generation working
- Census tract auto-fetching operational for all PA/FL locations

Next Focus - CONFIDENCE INTERVAL REFINEMENT:

I just completed a model run and the results are in:
/Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model/site_reports/Site_Analysis_v2_0_20251028_115124

The confidence intervals appear very large, almost unusable for business decisions.

Tasks:
1. Analyze the site report results
2. Investigate why confidence intervals are so wide
3. Identify opportunities to reduce interval width
4. Implement improvements while maintaining statistical integrity
5. Re-test with the same site to compare results

Reference Documents:
- docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_CENSUS_TRACT_FIX.md - Recent enhancements
- docs/PHASE6_MODEL_V2_COMPLETE.md - Model v2 details
- docs/MODEL_PERFORMANCE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md - Performance metrics
- CLAUDE.md - Project guidelines and context

Let's start by examining the site report and understanding the CI calculation.

## Context for AI Assistant

### Project State
- **Model Version**: v2.0 (corrected annual visits)
- **Performance**: Test R² = 0.1898, Cross-Val R² = 0.1812 ± 0.0661
- **Training Data**: 741 dispensaries (PA & FL)
- **Features**: 44 features (23 base + 21 derived)
- **Interface**: Complete CLI with coordinate-based input

### Recent Enhancements (Oct 28, 2025)
1. **On-the-Fly Census Tract Fetching**
   - Automatically fetches missing census tracts from Census API
   - Handles all PA/FL locations (not limited to pre-loaded 7,624 tracts)
   - Safe None value handling when Census data incomplete
   - Cached for performance

2. **Extreme Value Warning System**
   - Validates features against training data ranges
   - Prompts user for approval when values extreme
   - Batch mode flags sites with warnings in CSV
   - Transparent about prediction reliability

3. **Files Modified**
   - `src/feature_engineering/coordinate_calculator.py`: Added `_safe_float()`, `_safe_int()`, `_fetch_missing_tract()`, `_get_tract_centroid()`
   - `src/prediction/feature_validator.py`: Added `prepare_features_with_warnings()`
   - `src/terminal/cli.py`: Added user approval prompts for extreme values

### Current Capabilities
- ✅ Coordinate-based input (3-4 inputs vs 23 manual features)
- ✅ Multi-site analysis (up to 5 sites per session)
- ✅ Professional report generation (HTML/CSV/TXT/JSON)
- ✅ Automatic census tract fetching
- ✅ Extreme value detection and warnings
- ✅ State-specific confidence intervals
- ✅ Feature contribution analysis

### Known Issues to Address

#### 1. Wide Confidence Intervals (PRIMARY TASK)
**Issue**: Confidence intervals too wide for practical business use
**Location**: Site reports show CI ranges that may span 100k+ visits
**Impact**: Reduces decision-making value of predictions
**Investigation Needed**:
- Review CI calculation method in `src/prediction/predictor.py:150-227`
- Analyze state-specific RMSE values (FL: 33,162 vs PA: 56,581)
- Compare normal approximation vs bootstrap methods
- Examine residual distribution for CI assumptions
- Consider feature-based uncertainty quantification

**Potential Approaches**:
1. Ensemble-based confidence intervals
2. Conditional CIs based on feature extremity
3. Regularized prediction intervals
4. Bootstrap with stratification
5. Quantile regression for interval bounds

#### 2. Model Performance
**Current**: R² = 0.1812 (cross-val)
**Status**: Acceptable improvement (2.53x baseline) but room for enhancement
**Potential**: Could explore additional features or advanced methods

### Data Locations
- **Training Data**: `data/processed/combined_with_competitive_features_corrected.csv`
- **Model Artifact**: `data/models/multi_state_model_v2.pkl`
- **Feature Ranges**: `data/models/feature_ranges.json`
- **Census Data**: `data/census/intermediate/all_tracts_demographics.csv`
- **Site Reports**: `site_reports/Site_Analysis_v2_0_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`

### Key Files for CI Analysis
1. **Prediction Module**: `src/prediction/predictor.py`
   - Method: `predict_with_confidence()` (lines 150-227)
   - Uses state-specific RMSE for interval width
   - Implements both normal and bootstrap methods

2. **Model Training**: `src/modeling/train_multi_state_model.py`
   - RMSE calculation and state-specific metrics
   - Residual analysis

3. **Site Report**: User-specified directory
   - HTML report with visualizations
   - CSV with detailed metrics
   - JSON with full run data

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check model artifact
python3 -c "import pickle; m = pickle.load(open('data/models/multi_state_model_v2.pkl', 'rb')); print(f'Model RMSE: {m.get(\"test_rmse\")}')"

# View recent site report
ls -lt site_reports/ | head -5

# Verify census tract fetching works
python3 -c "from src.feature_engineering.coordinate_calculator import CoordinateFeatureCalculator; calc = CoordinateFeatureCalculator(); print('✓ Calculator ready')"
```

### User Preferences (from CLAUDE.md)
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
- Focus on requested changes only
- Use Git with feature branches
- Make frequent commits with clear messages
- Run tests before finalizing work
