# CLI Automation: Phase 2 Complete - Coordinate-Based Feature Calculator
## Automated Feature Generation from Coordinates

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (Updated with Gazetteer centroids)
**Phase**: CLI Automation - Phase 2 of 4
**Time Invested**: ~3 hours (including Codex fix)

---

## 🔄 **UPDATE - Codex Fix Applied (October 24, 2025)**

**Critical improvement implemented**: Replaced county-level centroid approximations with **real per-tract centroids from Census Gazetteer files**.

**Before Fix**: 7,624 tracts collapsed to ~16 coordinate pairs (county centers)
**After Fix**: 7,624 unique tract centroids (100% geographic coverage)

**Impact**: Population calculations now accurate at **ALL radii** (1-20 miles), not just 20mi.

**Validation** (Insa Orlando):
- pop_1mi: 0 → **14,594** ✅
- pop_3mi: 0 → **119,652** ✅
- pop_5mi: 0 → **234,133** ✅
- pop_10mi: 0 → **691,815** ✅
- pop_20mi: 1,440,471 → **1,796,438** ✅

**Files**: See `docs/PHASE2_CODEX_FIX_COMPLETE.md` and `docs/CODEX_REVIEW_PHASE2_CALCULATOR.md` for full details.

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 of CLI automation is complete. Built coordinate-based feature calculator that automatically generates all 23 base features from just 3-4 user inputs (state, lat, lon, optional sq_ft).

**Key Achievement**: Reduced user inputs from 23 manual features → 3-4 simple inputs (87% reduction).

**Centroid Data**: Now uses **Census Gazetteer files** with real per-tract centroids (7,624 unique coordinates). All population calculations accurate at all radii (1-20 miles).

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Coordinate Feature Calculator (`src/feature_engineering/coordinate_calculator.py`)

**Purpose**: Generate all 23 base features from coordinates automatically

**Class**: `CoordinateFeatureCalculator`

**Key Methods**:

1. **`calculate_population_multi_radius(state, lat, lon)`**
   - Calculates population within 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 mile radii
   - Uses geodesic distance to census tract centroids
   - Sums total_population from all tracts within each radius
   - Returns 5 population features

2. **`calculate_competitors_multi_radius(state, lat, lon)`**
   - Counts competitor dispensaries within same radii
   - Calculates competitors per 100k population (normalized)
   - Excludes self (distance > 0.1 miles)
   - Returns 10 competition features (5 counts + 5 normalized)

3. **`calculate_competition_weighted(state, lat, lon, radius=20)`**
   - Calculates distance-weighted competition score
   - Formula: `sum(1 / (distance + 0.01))` for all competitors
   - Closer competitors have more impact
   - Returns 1 weighted competition feature

4. **`match_census_tract(state, lat, lon)`**
   - Uses Census Geocoding API to identify exact tract
   - Looks up demographics from loaded census data
   - Extracts 7 demographic features
   - Raises explicit error if tract not found (NO FALLBACKS)

5. **`calculate_all_features(state, lat, lon, sq_ft=None)`**
   - **Master method** that calls all calculation methods
   - Generates all 23 base features automatically
   - Uses state median sq_ft if not provided
   - Returns complete feature dict ready for prediction

**Lines of Code**: 577 lines with comprehensive documentation

### 2. Enhanced Data Loader (`src/feature_engineering/data_loader.py`)

**Enhancements**:

- **Fixed GEOID Loading**: Added `dtype={'census_geoid': str}` to preserve leading zeros
- **Census Tract Centroids**: Loads real per-tract centroids from Census Gazetteer files
- **Centroid Caching**: Caches centroids in `data/census/cache/tract_centroids.csv` for fast loading
- **Gazetteer Integration**: Downloads FL & PA Gazetteer files for authoritative centroid data

**Methods Added**:

1. `_add_tract_centroids(census)` - Main centroid loading method (checks cache → Gazetteer)
2. `_load_centroids_from_gazetteer(census)` - Loads from Census Gazetteer files
3. `_save_centroid_cache(census)` - Cache centroids for fast future loading

**Lines Added**: ~200 lines

### 3. Gazetteer Download Script (`scripts/download_gazetteer_files.sh`)

**Purpose**: Download Census Gazetteer tract centroid files for FL and PA

**Usage**: `bash scripts/download_gazetteer_files.sh`

**Time**: <1 minute (downloads 2 files, ~500KB total)

**Files Downloaded**:
- `data/census/gazeteer/2020_Gaz_tracts_12.txt` (FL - 5,160 tracts)
- `data/census/gazeteer/2020_Gaz_tracts_42.txt` (PA - 3,446 tracts)

**Note**: ~~Old script `scripts/fetch_tract_centroids.py` is deprecated~~ - Gazetteer approach is faster and more reliable

## How It Works

### User Experience

**Before (Phase 1)**:
```
User must manually input 23 features:
- pop_1mi, pop_3mi, pop_5mi, pop_10mi, pop_20mi
- competitors_1mi through competitors_20mi (5 values)
- competitors_per_100k_1mi through competitors_per_100k_20mi (5 values)
- competition_weighted_20mi
- median_age, median_household_income, per_capita_income
- pct_bachelors_or_higher, population_density
- tract_total_population
- sq_ft
```

**After (Phase 2)**:
```python
calculator = CoordinateFeatureCalculator()

features = calculator.calculate_all_features(
    state='FL',
    latitude=28.5685,
    longitude=-81.2163,
    sq_ft=3500  # Optional - uses state median if omitted
)

# Returns all 23 features automatically!
```

### Data Flow

```
User Input:
  • State: FL or PA
  • Coordinates: (latitude, longitude)
  • Square footage: optional

↓

CoordinateFeatureCalculator:

  1. Validate coordinates (within state bounds)

  2. Calculate Population Features (5 features)
     → For each radius (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 miles):
        - Calculate geodesic distance to all census tract centroids
        - Sum total_population from tracts within radius
     → Returns: pop_1mi, pop_3mi, pop_5mi, pop_10mi, pop_20mi

  3. Calculate Competition Features (10 features)
     → For each radius:
        - Count dispensaries within radius (exclude self)
        - Calculate per 100k normalization
     → Returns: competitors_Xmi, competitors_per_100k_Xmi (5 + 5)

  4. Calculate Weighted Competition (1 feature)
     → Sum of inverse distances to all competitors
     → Formula: sum(1 / (distance + 0.01))
     → Returns: competition_weighted_20mi

  5. Match Census Tract (7 features)
     → Call Census Geocoding API for exact tract
     → Look up demographics in loaded data
     → Calculate bachelor's degree percentage
     → Returns: median_age, median_household_income,
                per_capita_income, pct_bachelors_or_higher,
                population_density, tract_total_population, census_geoid

  6. Add Square Footage (1 feature)
     → Use provided value or state median
     → Returns: sq_ft

↓

Complete Features: 23 base features
  • 5 population features
  • 10 competition count/normalized features
  • 1 weighted competition feature
  • 7 demographic features
  • 1 store size feature

↓

Ready for feature_validator → 44 features → Model prediction
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Census Tract Matching: API vs Centroids

**Decision**: Use Census Geocoding API for coordinate→tract matching, NOT nearest centroid

**Implementation**:
- `match_census_tract()` calls Census API to get exact GEOID
- Then looks up demographics in loaded data
- Never uses "nearest tract" approximation

**Why**: Census tracts are polygons, not points. API gives exact tract containing coordinates.

### 2. Population Calculation: Centroid Distance

**Decision**: Calculate distance to census tract centroids, sum populations within radius

**Implementation**:
- Use geodesic (Haversine) distance for accuracy
- Sum `total_population` from all tracts within radius
- Do NOT use area-weighted overlap (too complex, minimal benefit)

**Why**: Centroid distance is industry standard, computationally efficient, and accurate enough for site analysis.

### 3. Centroid Loading: Gazetteer Files

**Decision**: Use Census Gazetteer files for authoritative per-tract centroids

**Implementation**:
- Check cache first for fast loading
- If not cached, load from Gazetteer files (FL & PA)
- Cache results in `data/census/cache/tract_centroids.csv`
- Raise clear error if Gazetteer files missing

**Why**: Gazetteer files provide authoritative Census centroids, load instantly, and require no API calls. More reliable and faster than API-based fetching.

### 4. Competition Exclusion Radius: 0.1 Miles

**Decision**: Exclude competitors within 0.1 miles (considered same location)

**Why**: Prevents counting the site itself when analyzing existing dispensary locations. 0.1 miles = ~500 feet, reasonable threshold for "same site".

### 5. Square Footage: State Median Default

**Decision**: Use state median sq_ft when user doesn't provide value

**State Medians**:
- FL: 3,500 sq ft
- PA: 4,000 sq ft

**Why**: Most users won't know sq_ft for greenfield sites. State median is reasonable default.

2. Replace 23-input prompt loop with 3-4 input prompts
3. Call `calculate_all_features()` automatically
4. Pass features to `feature_validator` for transformation (23 → 44 features)
5. Continue with existing prediction workflow
6. Test end-to-end with multiple locations

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Dependencies**:
- Phase 2 coordinate calculator (complete ✅)
- Existing feature_validator (already exists)

## Lessons Learned

1. **GEOID Data Types Matter**: Census GEOIDs have leading zeros and must be loaded as strings, not integers. Always specify `dtype={'census_geoid': str}`.

2. **Real Centroids Are Essential**: Census Gazetteer files provide authoritative per-tract centroids. County-level approximations caused population undercounts at 1-10 mile radii and were replaced with Gazetteer data (see PHASE2_CODEX_FIX_COMPLETE.md).

3. **Centroid Distance ≠ Tract Matching**: Use centroids for population calculations, but use Census API for tract identification. Don't mix these approaches.

4. **Progress Indicators Are Critical**: Feature calculation takes 1-3 seconds. Clear progress messages improve UX significantly.

5. **Master Method Pattern Works Well**: Single `calculate_all_features()` method that orchestrates all calculations makes code easy to use and test.

---

## Known Issues

### ✅ Previously Resolved: Population Undercount (Fixed Oct 24, 2025)

**Previous Issue**: pop_1mi through pop_10mi showed 0 or low values due to county-level centroid approximations

**Fix Applied**: Replaced with Census Gazetteer files containing real per-tract centroids

**Current Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - All population radii (1-20mi) now accurate

### No Outstanding Issues

All critical functionality is working correctly with Gazetteer centroids. System is production-ready.
