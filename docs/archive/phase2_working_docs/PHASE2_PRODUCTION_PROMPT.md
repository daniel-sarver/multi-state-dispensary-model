# Phase 2 Production Run - Continuation Prompt

**Use this prompt after compacting to run census data collection on all 741 training dispensaries**

---

I'd like to resume work on my Multi-State Dispensary Model project.

We've completed **Phase 2 Implementation** (Census Demographics Integration). All 5 modules have been built, tested on a 20-dispensary sample, and validated with Codex review fixes applied.

I'm now ready to run the **production census data collection** on all 741 training dispensaries.

## Current Status

**Phase 1**: âœ… Complete (741 training dispensaries with Placer data)
**Phase 2 Implementation**: âœ… Complete (5 modules built and tested)
**Phase 2 Production Run**: ðŸš§ Ready to execute

## What's Been Completed

### Modules Built (All Tested)
1. **CensusTractIdentifier** - Geocoding â†’ FIPS codes (100% success on sample)
2. **ACSDataCollector** - ACS API â†’ demographics (2,650 tracts on sample)
3. **GeographicAnalyzer** - Multi-radius populations with area-weighting (validated)
4. **CensusFeatureEngineer** - Education % + density (100% calculation)
5. **CensusDataIntegrator** - Merge with datasets (clean integration)

### Sample Validation (20 Dispensaries)
- âœ… 100% census tract identification
- âœ… 2,650 unique tracts collected (vs 20 home tracts - Codex fix applied)
- âœ… 100% population density calculated (tract areas wired through - Codex fix applied)
- âœ… Realistic population growth: 44x-148x from 1mi to 20mi
- âœ… All populations monotonically increasing

### Critical Fixes Applied
1. **Multi-radius populations**: Now collects ACS data for ALL intersecting tracts (not just home tracts)
2. **Population density**: Tract areas properly passed through entire pipeline

## Production Run Details

**Command**:
```bash
cd /Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model
python3 src/feature_engineering/collect_census_data.py
```

**Expected Performance** (first run on 741 dispensaries):
- Census tract identification: ~10-15 min (741 geocoding calls)
- Intersecting tracts identification: ~5-10 min (geometric calculations)
- **ACS demographics collection: ~1-2 hours** (estimated 15,000-20,000 unique tracts)
- Multi-radius calculations: ~15-20 min (area-weighted geometric ops)
- Feature engineering & integration: ~5 min

**Total First Run**: ~2-2.5 hours
**Subsequent Runs** (with cache): ~15-20 min

## Output

**Updated Datasets** (with 24 new census columns):
- `data/processed/FL_combined_dataset_current.csv` (735 dispensaries)
- `data/processed/PA_combined_dataset_current.csv` (202 dispensaries)

**Original Files Archived Automatically**:
- `data/processed/FL_combined_dataset_pre_census_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- `data/processed/PA_combined_dataset_pre_census_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

**Validation Reports**:
- `data/census/FL_census_integration_report.json`
- `data/census/PA_census_integration_report.json`

## New Features Added (24 Total)

### Census Tract (5)
- census_state_fips, census_county_fips, census_tract_fips
- census_geoid, census_tract_name

### Demographics (9)
- total_population, median_age
- median_household_income, per_capita_income
- total_pop_25_plus, bachelors/masters/professional/doctorate degrees

### Multi-Radius Population (5)
- pop_1mi, pop_3mi, pop_5mi, pop_10mi, pop_20mi
- All area-weighted (tract_pop Ã— intersection_area / tract_area)

### Derived Features (2)
- pct_bachelor_plus (% with bachelor's+)
- population_density (people per sq mi)

### Quality Flags (3)
- census_tract_error, census_data_complete, census_api_error

## Success Criteria

Target for production run:
- âœ… Census tracts identified for >95% of 741 dispensaries
- âœ… Demographics collected for all identified tracts
- âœ… Multi-radius populations calculated with area-weighting
- âœ… Monotonic increase validated (1mi â‰¤ 3mi â‰¤ ... â‰¤ 20mi)
- âœ… Population density calculated for all dispensaries
- âœ… Data quality report shows <5% missing values

## Important Technical Notes

**Census API Key**: Already configured in `.env` file
**Key**: c26b82b224759f99b221fe3392e5b1809eb443c0

**Critical Implementation Details**:
1. **Area-Weighting**: `pop = Î£(tract_pop Ã— intersection_area / tract_area)` - prevents over-counting
2. **CRS**: State-specific Albers (EPSG:3086 FL, EPSG:6565 PA) - accurate circular buffers
3. **Multi-Radius**: 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 miles based on Insa trade area data (19% from 30+ miles)

## Key Documents

**Architecture**: `/Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model/docs/PHASE2_ARCHITECTURE.md` (v1.2)
**Implementation Summary**: `/Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model/docs/PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
**Codex Fixes**: `/Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model/docs/CODEX_REVIEW_PHASE2.md`

## What To Do

1. **Run Production Collection**:
   ```bash
   python3 src/feature_engineering/collect_census_data.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Log file: `census_collection_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
   - Progress updates every 25 dispensaries
   - Intermediate checkpoints saved automatically

3. **After Completion**:
   - Review validation reports in `data/census/*_integration_report.json`
   - Verify >95% completion rate
   - Check monotonic population increases
   - Validate value ranges

4. **Generate Final Report**:
   - Create Phase 2 completion report
   - Update README with production statistics
   - Commit updated datasets to git
   - Push to GitHub

## Expected Results

Based on sample validation, production run should achieve:
- **741/741 dispensaries** processed
- **15,000-20,000 unique tracts** with demographics
- **100% tract identification** success rate
- **>95% complete demographic data**
- **100% population density** calculation
- **Realistic multi-radius populations** (40x-150x growth 1miâ†’20mi)

## Next Phase

After successful production run:
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced feature engineering and model training
- **Target**: RÂ² > 0.15 (vs 0.0716 PA baseline)
- **Features**: Census demographics + competition + state factors

**Ready to proceed with production census data collection!**

Let me know if you'd like me to:
1. Start the production run immediately
2. Review the architecture first
3. Test with a larger sample before full run
4. Something else
