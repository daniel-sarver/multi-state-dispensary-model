# Continuation Prompt for Next Session

**Use this prompt after compacting the chat to resume work on Phase 2: Census Demographics Integration**

---

## Context

I'm working on a Multi-State Dispensary Prediction Model project to improve on the PA Dispensary Model we developed previously. The goal is to create a model with better predictive power by training on a larger dataset (~750 dispensaries across PA & FL vs the original ~150 in PA only).

## What We've Completed: Phase 1 - Data Integration ✅

We successfully completed Phase 1 and have a solid data foundation:

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Created combined datasets for PA & FL using state regulator data as source of truth
- Integrated fresh Placer data (Oct 2024 - Sep 2025) via enhanced address matching
- **741 training-eligible dispensaries** with complete visit data and coordinates (98.8% of 750 target)
- **937 total dispensaries** for comprehensive competitive landscape analysis
- Systematically filtered 54 hemp/CBD stores using cannabis brand whitelist approach
- Enhanced matching with composite scoring (address + city + ZIP) achieving 96-98% avg confidence
- All work committed and pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/daniel-sarver/multi-state-dispensary-model

**Key Files to Review:**
- `/docs/PHASE1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Complete Phase 1 summary with code review improvements
- `/docs/CODE_REVIEW_FIXES.md` - Detailed documentation of enhancements (+98 dispensaries recovered)
- `/data/processed/FL_combined_dataset_current.csv` - 735 FL dispensaries (590 training-eligible)
- `/data/processed/PA_combined_dataset_current.csv` - 202 PA dispensaries (151 training-eligible)
- `/src/data_integration/create_combined_datasets.py` - Enhanced data processing pipeline
- `/tests/test_data_integration.py` - Comprehensive test suite for regression prevention

## What's Next: Phase 2 - Census Demographics Integration

**Objective:** Add demographic features to our 741 training-eligible dispensaries to enhance model predictive power.

**Approach:**
1. **Automated Census Data Collection** using US Census Bureau API (public government data)
2. **Multi-Radius Population Analysis** - Calculate population within 1mi, 3mi, 5mi, 10mi of each dispensary
3. **Demographic Profiling** - Age distribution, household income, per capita income, education levels, population density
4. **Feature Engineering** - Create demographic variables ready for model training

**Key Requirements:**
- Use US Census Bureau API for automated, programmatic data collection (this is acceptable since it's public government data)
- Pull data for all 741 training-eligible dispensaries (those with `has_placer_data: True`)
- Census tract-level demographic data based on dispensary coordinates
- Multiple radius analysis to capture market area demographics
- Maintain data integrity standards (real data only, comprehensive validation)

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Census data integration script using Census API
- Enhanced combined datasets with demographic features
- Data quality validation and summary reports
- Documentation of census methodology and data sources

## Important Project Context

**Data Integrity Principles (CRITICAL):**
- NEVER use synthetic data without explicit approval
- ALWAYS use verified real data from legitimate sources
- Census data is acceptable to pull automatically (public government API)
- All other proprietary data comes from me (Daniel) directly

**Project Organization:**
- Follow GitHub best practices with clear commits
- Keep documentation comprehensive but concise
- Build on existing PA Dispensary Model patterns
- Use descriptive file naming and clear logging

**Success Metrics:**
- Target R² > 0.15 (significant improvement over PA model's 0.0716)
- 4.3x larger training set than original model
- Validate against Insa actual performance data
- Maintain clean terminal interface like PA model

## Next Steps for You

1. **Review Phase 1 completion** - Read `/docs/PHASE1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` and `/docs/CODE_REVIEW_FIXES.md`
2. **Examine combined datasets** - Understand the structure of our 741 training dispensaries
3. **Plan Census Integration** - Design the census data collection and integration approach
4. **Build Census Tool** - Create automated script to pull demographics via Census API
5. **Integrate & Validate** - Add demographic features to combined datasets with quality checks

## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Which dispensaries should get census data?**
A: All 741 dispensaries where `has_placer_data: True` in the combined datasets

**Q: What census variables do we need?**
A: Population, age distribution, household income, per capita income, education levels, population density

**Q: What radii should we analyze?**
A: 1 mile, 3 miles, 5 miles, and 10 miles around each dispensary

**Q: Can I pull census data automatically?**
A: Yes! Census Bureau API is public government data and acceptable to pull programmatically

**Q: What about the regulator-only dispensaries?**
A: They won't be used for training, so census data not needed yet. They're for competition analysis later.

## Ready to Begin!

Please review the Phase 1 completion report and combined datasets, then let's start Phase 2 by designing the census data integration approach. Let me know when you've reviewed the materials and are ready to proceed with census demographics integration.
