# Session Summary - Report v3.0 Improvements & Scoring System

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Focus**: Updating reports to v3.0 and implementing 1-5 scoring system from PA model

---

## Session Overview

Finalized the Multi-State Dispensary Model v3.0 by updating all report generation to reflect state-specific models and implementing the proven 1-5 scoring system from the PA Dispensary Model, ensuring consistency across both modeling platforms.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Version Number Updates ✅

**Issue Identified**:
- Report folder names showed "v2_0" instead of "v3_0"
- HTML reports referenced "Model v2.0" throughout
- Text reports and receipts showed v2.0
- CLI display showed v2.0

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `_create_output_folder()` to generate `Site_Analysis_v3_0_[timestamp]`
- HTML title: "Multi-State Dispensary Site Analysis Report v3.0"
- HTML header subtitle: "Model v3.0"
- Text report header: "MULTI-STATE DISPENSARY PREDICTION MODEL v3.0"
- Text report footer: "Multi-State Dispensary Prediction Model v3.0"
- JSON receipt: `model_version: "v3.0"`
- CLI header: Displays "Model Version: v3.0"

**Files Modified**: `src/reporting/report_generator.py`, `src/terminal/cli.py`

### 2. Footer Content Overhaul ✅

**Previous Footer** (Technical metrics):
- Test R² = 0.1898
- Cross-Val R² = 0.1812 ± 0.0661
- Training Data: 741 dispensaries
- Model Type: Ridge Regression with state interaction terms

**New Footer** (Performance-focused):

**Florida (Ridge Regression)**
- Within-state R² = 0.0685 (explains 6.85% of variance within Florida)
- Best use: Comparative ranking of FL sites
- Typical prediction variance: ±40-50%

**Pennsylvania (Random Forest)**
- Within-state R² = 0.0756 (explains 7.56% of variance within Pennsylvania)
- Best use: Comparative ranking of PA sites
- Typical prediction variance: ±40-50%

**Important Guidance**:
- Clear statement: "This model is a comparative ranking tool, not a precision forecasting instrument"
- Best practices: "Best used to rank 5-10 candidate sites within the same state and focus due diligence on top performers"
- Integration recommendation: "Predictions should be combined with site visits, local market intelligence, and strategic analysis"
- Training data: "741 dispensaries (FL: 590, PA: 151)"

**Rationale**:
- More honest about model capabilities and limitations
- Provides actionable guidance on appropriate use cases
- State-specific metrics align with v3.0 architecture
- Helps users understand what the model can and cannot do

### 3. Percentile Scoring System Implementation ✅

**Initial Implementation** (Letter Grades):
- Used A+ through D- grading scale (10 grades)
- Color-coded display boxes
- Percentile ranges for each grade

**User Feedback**:
- Request to match PA Dispensary Model's numbering system
- PA model uses 1-5 scale proven in production

**Final Implementation** (1-5 Numeric Scale):

**Scoring Scale**:
- **5.0** - Exceptional - Top 10% of sites (≥90th percentile) - Green (#27AE60)
- **4.0** - Above Average - 70th-90th percentile - Teal (#048A81)
- **3.0** - Average - 30th-70th percentile - Orange (#F39C12)
- **2.0** - Below Average - 10th-30th percentile - Dark Orange (#E67E22)
- **1.0** - Poor - Bottom 10% of sites (<10th percentile) - Red (#E74C3C)

**Visual Display**:
- Circular score badge: 120px diameter with 6px colored border
- Score displayed as "3.0/5" format (matches PA model exactly)
- Color-coded background with 15% opacity
- Integrated layout showing:
  - Score badge (left)
  - Site Performance Score header
  - Description (e.g., "Average - 30th-70th percentile")
  - Market Percentile percentage
  - Predicted Annual Visits

**Score Key in Footer**:
- 5-column grid displaying all scores
- Color-coded boxes with transparent backgrounds
- Clear descriptions and percentile ranges
- Note: "Scores compare predicted performance against all dispensaries in the same state (FL: 590, PA: 151)"

**Calculation Method**:
```python
def _calculate_percentile_score(self, predicted_visits: float, state: str):
    # Load training data for the same state
    # Calculate: (sites with lower visits) / (total sites) * 100
    # Assign score based on percentile thresholds
    # Return score, percentile, description, and color
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistency with PA Dispensary Model (familiar to existing users)
- Clear numeric scale (1-5 more intuitive than letter grades)
- Visual consistency across modeling platforms
- Easy to understand and communicate to stakeholders

### 4. Bug Fixes ✅

**Issue 1: Text Report Footer Version**
- **Problem**: Text report footer showed "Model v2.0"
- **Solution**: Updated to "Multi-State Dispensary Prediction Model v3.0"
- **Commit**: `958a1e4`

**Issue 2: CSV Rank Ordering**
- **Problem**: CSV had rank 2 in first data row when rank 1 should be first
- **Root Cause**: Results list ordered by predicted visits (descending) for display, but CSV didn't re-sort
- **Solution**: Added `df = df.sort_values('rank')` before saving CSV
- **Commit**: `00cb557`
- **Impact**: CSV now properly shows rank 1 in first row while maintaining correct rank values

## Technical Implementation Details

### Report Generator Updates

**Method**: `_calculate_percentile_score(predicted_visits, state)`
- Loads training data from `combined_with_competitive_features_corrected.csv`
- Filters to training dispensaries in same state
- Calculates percentile: `(training < predicted_visits).sum() / len(training) * 100`
- Assigns score (1.0-5.0) based on percentile thresholds
- Returns dict with score, percentile, description, and color
- Graceful error handling with fallback to "Score unavailable"

**Integration into `_build_site_section()`**:
```python
# Calculate percentile score
score_info = self._calculate_percentile_score(
    result.get('predicted_visits', 0),
    result.get('state', 'FL')
)

# Display circular badge with score
<div style="width: 120px; height: 120px; border-radius: 50%;
     border: 6px solid {score_info['color']};
     background-color: {score_info['color']}15;">
    <div>{score_info['score']:.1f}/5</div>
</div>
```

**Footer Score Key**:
```python
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
     gap: 10px;">
    # 5 color-coded boxes, one for each score
</div>
```
