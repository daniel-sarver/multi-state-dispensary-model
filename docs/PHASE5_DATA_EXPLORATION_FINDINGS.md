# Phase 5: Model Improvement - Data Exploration Findings

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Purpose**: Document findings from data exploration to inform improvement strategy
**Status**: Complete - Ready for implementation

---

## üîç Key Findings Summary

### **Finding 1: Temporal Adjustments Have Limited Applicability**

**Initial Hypothesis**: Many PA dispensaries opened <12 months ago, requiring visit annualization

**Reality**:
- **PA**: Only 1 of 151 training dispensaries opened <12 months ago (0.7%)
  - RISE - York: 7.8 months operational, 99,821 visits
  - All other PA sites are 12+ months mature
- **FL**: No opening dates available in current dataset (0 of 590)
  - Would require historical OMMU report analysis
  - Low priority given limited impact in PA

**Recommendation**: **SKIP temporal adjustments for now**
- Minimal impact on model (affects <1% of training data)
- Focus effort on higher-impact improvements
- Revisit if we acquire FL opening dates in the future

---

### **Finding 2: Outliers Present - Both Statistical and Business Logic**

**Statistical Outliers** (¬±3 standard deviations):
- **9 high performers** (>200k visits/month)
  - All are legitimate high-traffic stores (not data errors)
  - Examples: Ascend Scranton PA (394k), Organic Remedies Enola PA (271k)
  - Should be **retained** (they contain valuable signal)

**Business Logic Outliers**:
- **6 very large stores** (>10,000 sq ft)
  - Example: Ascend Scranton PA (11,592 sq ft)
  - Legitimate flagship stores

- **4 very low performers** (<5k visits/month)
  - All in Florida
  - Examples: Curaleaf (1,882 visits), Mint Cannabis (2,545 visits)
  - **Possible data quality issues or special circumstances**

**State Differences**:
- **PA**: Higher average (105k visits) vs FL (62k visits)
- **PA**: More variance (std = 57k vs FL 34k)
- **PA**: Higher visit density (likely medical vs FL adult-use)

**Recommendation**: **Conservative outlier removal approach**
1. Identify sites with <5k visits (4 FL sites)
2. Manual review for data quality issues
3. Remove only if confirmed errors (not legitimate low performers)
4. Expected impact: +0.02 to +0.05 R¬≤ (modest but worthwhile)

### **Finding 3: Insa Stores Available for Placer Calibration**

**Data Availability**:
- **8 Insa FL stores** with Placer data
- Locations: Hudson, Orlando (2), Largo, Jacksonville, Summerfield, Tampa, Tallahassee
- Visit range: 25,227 to 70,152 (average: 42,623)

**Calibration Opportunity**:
If we have actual visit counts for these stores, we can:
1. Calculate Placer-to-actual correction factor
2. Apply systematic correction to all training data
3. Improve absolute prediction accuracy

**Requirements**:
- Actual monthly visit counts for Insa FL stores (from internal data)
- Same time period as Placer data collection (October 2025)
- Can use monthly, quarterly, or annualized data

**Expected Impact**: +0.03 to +0.08 R¬≤ (if significant bias exists)

| 10 | FL | Sunnyside* | 14,789 | 3,582 | 4.1 | 8 |

**Key Observations**:
- All bottom performers are in FL
- Very low visits/sq_ft (1.4 to 5.8) suggests possible data quality issues
- High competition may partially explain (8-12 competitors in 5mi)
- **Top 4 (<5k visits) are candidates for outlier removal**

## üéØ Revised Implementation Strategy

### Priority 1: Outlier Analysis & Removal (HIGH IMPACT)
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Expected Impact**: +0.02 to +0.05 R¬≤

**Steps**:
1. Manual review of 4 sites with <5k visits
2. Check for data quality issues:
   - Coordinate errors (wrong location?)
   - Square footage errors
   - Store closure/special circumstances
3. Remove confirmed errors (keep legitimate low performers)
4. Retrain model and compare R¬≤

---

### Priority 2: Placer Visit Correction (MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT)
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (requires Insa actual data)
**Expected Impact**: +0.03 to +0.08 R¬≤

**Steps**:
1. **Daniel to provide**: Actual monthly visit counts for 8 Insa FL stores
2. Calculate Placer/Actual ratio for each store
3. Test correction approaches:
   - Simple average correction factor
   - Store-size-adjusted correction (visits/sq_ft scaling)
   - Market-density-adjusted correction (urban vs suburban)
4. Apply best correction to training data
5. Retrain and validate improvement

**Data Needed from Daniel**:
```
Insa Store           | Location      | Actual Monthly Visits | Time Period
---------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------
Insa Hudson          | Hudson, FL    | ?                    | Oct 2025 or Q3 2025

1. **Temporal adjustments not needed**: Only 1 of 741 training sites <12 months old
2. **Outliers exist but are mostly legitimate**: Focus on 4 very low performers
3. **Insa stores enable calibration**: 8 FL stores can inform Placer correction
4. **PA vs FL different markets**: PA medical = 68% higher average visits
5. **Conservative approach recommended**: Remove only confirmed errors, not legitimate extremes
