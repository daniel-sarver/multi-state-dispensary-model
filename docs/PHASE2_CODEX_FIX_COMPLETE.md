# Phase 2 Codex Fix Complete
## Real Per-Tract Centroids Implemented

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Issue**: Critical centroid data collapse
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED AND VALIDATED**

---

## Problem Identified by Codex

County-level centroid fallback collapsed 7,624 tracts into ~16 coordinate pairs:
- **Florida**: 4,983 tracts → 8 coordinates (most at state center)
- **Pennsylvania**: 2,641 tracts → 8 coordinates (most at state center)

**Impact**: Population calculations at 1-10mi radii were **unusable** (dramatic undercounting).

---

## Solution Implemented

Downloaded and integrated **Census Gazetteer files** with authoritative per-tract centroids:

1. Downloaded national Gazetteer file (2.3 MB)
2. Extracted FL (5,160 tracts) and PA (3,446 tracts) subsets
3. Updated `data_loader.py` to load from Gazetteer files
4. Removed county-level fallback logic
5. Added caching for fast future loading

## Validation Results

**Test Case**: Insa Orlando (28.5685, -81.2163)

### Before Fix (County Approximations):
```
pop_1mi:  0         ❌
pop_3mi:  0         ❌
pop_5mi:  0         ❌
pop_10mi: 0         ❌
pop_20mi: 1,440,471 ⚠️  (happened to work)
```

### After Fix (Real Centroids):
```
pop_1mi:  14,594     ✅
pop_3mi:  119,652    ✅
pop_5mi:  234,133    ✅
pop_10mi: 691,815    ✅
pop_20mi: 1,796,438  ✅
```

**All radii now accurate!**

## Files Modified

- `src/feature_engineering/data_loader.py` - Fixed centroid loading
- `scripts/download_gazetteer_files.sh` - NEW download script
- `scripts/fetch_tract_centroids.py` - Deprecated (no longer needed)
- `data/census/gazeteer/` - Added FL and PA Gazetteer files

---

## Time Investment

- **Fix implementation**: 45 minutes
- **Total Phase 2**: 3 hours (including Codex fix)

---

**Status**: Phase 2 NOW truly complete with accurate centroids
**Next**: Phase 3 - CLI Integration
