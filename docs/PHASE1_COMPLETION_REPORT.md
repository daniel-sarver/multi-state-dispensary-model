## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fresh Data Collection (October 22, 2025)

**Placer Data** (12-month period: Oct 2024 - Sep 2025):
- Florida: 714 dispensaries with visit estimates
- Pennsylvania: 189 dispensaries with visit estimates
- **Total**: 903 dispensaries with complete Placer data

**State Regulator Data**:
- Florida: 734 licensed dispensaries (complete list)
- Pennsylvania: 205 final licenses + 10 Act 63 provisional licenses
- **Total**: 949 dispensaries in regulatory landscape

**Validation Data**:
- 18 Insa stores with actual vs Placer visit comparisons
- Time period: May 1, 2024 - April 30, 2025

### 2. Combined Dataset Creation

**Methodology**:
- State regulator data used as **source of truth** for complete competitive landscape
- Placer data integrated via address matching (exact + fuzzy matching)
- Hemp/CBD stores filtered from both states
- Dual-purpose coding: training-eligible vs competition-only dispensaries

**Results** (After Code Review Improvements):

| State | Total Dispensaries | Training-Eligible | Competition-Only | Act 63 Provisional |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Florida | 735 | 590 (80.3%) | 145 (19.7%) | 0 |
| Pennsylvania | 202 | 151 (74.8%) | 40 (19.8%) | 11 (5.4%) |
| **TOTAL** | **937** | **741** | **185** | **11** |

**Data Quality**:
- **741 training-eligible dispensaries** (98.8% of ~750 target, +98 from initial version)
- 100% coordinate coverage for Placer-matched dispensaries
- 100% visit data coverage for training set
- Cannabis-only filtering: 94.8% FL, 91.0% PA (54 hemp/CBD stores removed)
- Coordinate boundary validation: 100% of matched records within state boundaries

### 3. Address Matching Performance

**Matching Statistics** (After Enhancements):
- **Florida**: 590 matched (354 exact, 236 fuzzy) - Average score: 96.3
- **Pennsylvania**: 151 matched (105 exact, 46 fuzzy) - Average score: 97.7
- **Total matched**: 741 dispensaries (459 exact, 282 fuzzy)
- **Unmatched Placer**: 108 records (87 FL, 21 PA) - legitimate stores not in regulator data or address mismatches

**Matching Enhancements**:
- Composite scoring: 60% address similarity + 25% city match + 15% ZIP match
- Multi-candidate evaluation prevents incorrect regulator record drops
- Minimum thresholds: 75% address similarity, 80% composite score
- Match details tracked: `addr:XX|city:YY|zip:ZZ` for transparency

**Quality Assurance**:
- Coordinate boundary validation: PA (39.5-42.5°N, -80.5--74.5°W), FL (24.5-31.0°N, -87.5--80.0°W)
- Invalid coordinates automatically cleared while preserving records
- Visit data range validation (301 - 475,108 annual visits)
- Duplicate detection and removal

## Code Review Improvements (October 22, 2025)

Following a comprehensive code review by Codex, several critical improvements were implemented:

### Issues Identified & Resolved

1. **Hemp/CBD Filtering Over-Exclusion** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: Keyword filtering removed legitimate dispensaries (Surterra Wellness, Ayr Wellness)
   - **Solution**: Implemented cannabis brand whitelist + category-based filtering
   - **Impact**: Recovered stores that would have been incorrectly filtered

2. **Address Matching Drops Valid Records** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: First-match logic deleted regulator records after matching, dropping subsequent matches
   - **Solution**: Track matched indices in a set, preserve all regulator records during iteration
   - **Impact**: Recovered 98 training dispensaries (FL +79, PA +19)

3. **Single-Factor Matching Insufficient** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: Only street address compared, missed matches due to format differences
   - **Solution**: Composite scoring with city (25%) and ZIP (15%) factors
   - **Impact**: Higher match quality and disambiguation of similar addresses

4. **Coordinate Validation Not Implemented** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: `state_bounds` dict defined but never used
   - **Solution**: Added `validate_coordinates()` method called in processing pipeline
   - **Impact**: Automated detection and clearing of invalid coordinates

5. **Missing Dependencies & Tests** ❌ → ✅
   - **Problem**: No requirements.txt, no automated testing
   - **Solution**: Created requirements.txt with pinned versions, comprehensive test suite
   - **Impact**: Prevents future regressions, enables CI/CD

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Data Gaps

1. **Placer Coverage**: Only 68.6% of licensed dispensaries have Placer data
   - Larger chains better represented
   - Standalone buildings over strip malls
   - Older dispensaries over newer ones

2. **Opening Dates**: Only available for PA regulator data
   - FL opening dates not included in regulator dataset
   - Will need to flag <1 year dispensaries for PA only

3. **Square Footage**: Available only where Placer data exists
   - May need estimation for regulator-only sites if required for modeling

### Data Quality Notes

1. **Address Matching**: Fuzzy matches (29.4%) may have minor address discrepancies
2. **Regulator Data**: Some known inaccuracies in state lists (per Daniel's note)
3. **Placer Inflation**: Known issue - Placer tends to overestimate visits
4. **CBD Stores**: Keyword filtering may have false positives/negatives

## Learnings & Insights

### What Matters for Dataset Quality

1. **Source of Truth Approach**: Using regulator data as foundation ensures complete competitive landscape
2. **Dual-Dataset Strategy**: Combining comprehensive competition data with training subset is optimal
3. **Automated Filtering**: Systematic hemp/CBD removal is more reliable than manual review
4. **Address Matching**: High-confidence fuzzy matching (>85%) provides good results without manual review

### Data Collection Best Practices

1. **Fresh Data**: Pulling all datasets on same date ensures temporal consistency
2. **Complete Lists**: State regulator data critical for accurate competition analysis
3. **Validation Data**: Insa actual performance provides crucial reality check
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive logging and summary files enable reproducibility

## Next Steps: Phase 2 - Census Demographics Integration

### Objectives

1. **Automated Census Data Collection**: Pull demographics for all 643 training dispensaries
2. **Multi-Radius Analysis**: Calculate population within 1mi, 3mi, 5mi, 10mi buffers
3. **Demographic Profiling**: Age, income, education, population density by census tract
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create demographic variables for model training

### Approach

- Use US Census Bureau API for automated data collection
- Census tract identification based on dispensary coordinates
- Demographic aggregation at multiple radius levels
- Integration with combined datasets

### Expected Timeline

- Census data collection: 1-2 days
- Feature engineering: 2-3 days
- Validation and quality checks: 1 day
- **Total**: ~1 week
