**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Focus**: Improving report visual design for better readability and user experience

## Work Completed

### 1. Replace Confidence Column with Score in Rankings Table âœ…

**User Request**:
> "In the Site Rankings & Comparison grid can you replace the 'Confidence' column with the score?"

**Issue Identified**:
- Rankings table showed "Confidence" column with HIGH/MODERATE/LOW indicators
- Confidence level was based on CI range width, not site performance
- Duplicate information (confidence also shown in detail sections)
- Score information was more valuable for quick site comparison

**Changes Made**:
- **Table Header**: Changed `<th>Confidence</th>` to `<th>Score</th>`
- **Cell Content**: Replaced confidence indicators with calculated scores
- **Scoring Logic**: Added `_calculate_percentile_score()` call for each site in table
- **Display Format**: Shows "4.0/5" format with color-coding
- **Styling**: Center-aligned, bold text with score-specific colors

**Implementation** (src/reporting/report_generator.py):
```python
# Calculate score for this site
score_info = self._calculate_percentile_score(
    result.get('predicted_visits', 0),
    result.get('state', 'FL')
)

# Display in table
<td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: {score_info['color']};">
    {score_info['score']:.1f}/5
</td>
```

**Benefits**:
- Quick visual assessment of site performance at a glance
- Consistent with detailed scoring in individual site sections
- Color-coded for immediate interpretation
- More actionable than confidence intervals for comparison

### 2. Remove Colored Backgrounds from Metric Boxes âœ…

**User Request**:
> "Please remove the green background color for the box in the detail for each site it makes it difficult to read"

**Issue Identified**:
- Population metric boxes had teal background (`rgba(4,138,129,0.1)`)
- Competition metric boxes had orange background (`rgba(230,126,34,0.1)`)
- Colored backgrounds reduced text contrast and readability
- Made the reports feel cluttered and harder to scan

**Changes Made**:

**Phase 1 - Population and Competition Boxes**:
```css
/* Before */
.metric-box.population {
    background-color: rgba(4,138,129,0.1);  /* Teal */
}
.metric-box.competition {
    background-color: rgba(230,126,34,0.1);  /* Orange */
}

/* After */
.metric-box.population {
    background-color: #f8f9fa;  /* Neutral light gray */
}
.metric-box.competition {
    background-color: #f8f9fa;  /* Neutral light gray */
}
```

**Commit**: `ee74d37` (same commit as score column)

### 3. Remove Green Gradient from Prediction Box âœ…

**User Feedback** (after testing):
> "I'm still seeing the green background, can you fix?" [Screenshot showed prediction box]

**Issue Identified**:
- Large prediction box section had green-to-teal gradient background
- White text on colored gradient reduced readability
- Did not follow modern design best practices for data presentation
- Made confidence intervals and scores harder to read

**Changes Made**:

**Prediction Box**:
```css
/* Before */
.prediction-box {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #048A81, #F77F00);
    color: white;
}

/* After */
.prediction-box {
    background: #f8f9fa;
    color: #333;
    border: 2px solid {colors['primary']};  /* Teal border for branding */
}
```

**Visits Number**:
```css
/* Before */
.prediction-box .visits {
    color: white;  /* Inherited */
}

/* After */
.prediction-box .visits {
    color: #2E4057;  /* Navy blue for emphasis */
}
```

**Label Text**:
```css
/* Before */
.prediction-box .label {
    color: white;
    opacity: 0.9;
}

/* After */
.prediction-box .label {
    color: #666;  /* Medium gray */
}
```

**Confidence Box**:
```css
/* Before */
.confidence-box {
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.2);  /* Semi-transparent white */
}

/* After */
.confidence-box {
    background: #ffffff;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Dramatically improved readability** - dark text on light background
- **Professional appearance** - clean, modern design
- **Better contrast** - meets WCAG accessibility standards
- **Maintains branding** - subtle teal border preserves state identity
- **Easier scanning** - neutral backgrounds let data stand out
