# Critical Fix: Double-Scaling Issue in Test Evaluation

**Date**: October 23, 2025 (Post Phase 3b)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Test R² was incorrectly calculated as -0.1788 instead of 0.1940

---

## Issue Summary

### Blocking Issue: Double-Scaling of Test Data

**Problem Discovered**: The model's test set performance was incorrectly calculated due to double-scaling of features.

**Root Cause**:
- `prepare_training_data.py:447-448` returned PRE-SCALED test data (`X_test_scaled`)
- `train_multi_state_model.py` then fed this into `Pipeline([StandardScaler(), Ridge()])`
- The Pipeline scaled the already-scaled features again
- Double-standardization tanked test performance from R² = 0.1940 to R² = -0.1788

**Discovery**: Codex review identified this after seeing saved model report showed test R² = -0.1788, contradicting advertised 0.1940 test R² in documentation.

## Technical Details

### Before Fix (INCORRECT):

```python
# In prepare_training_data.py:
def prepare_data(self, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, scale=True):
    # ... preparation steps ...

    if scale:
        X_train_out = self.X_train.copy()  # Unscaled for CV
        X_test_scaled, scaler = self.scale_test_only()  # ❌ PRE-SCALED
        X_test_out = X_test_scaled  # ❌ Returns scaled test data
        self.scaler = scaler

    return {
        'X_train': X_train_out,
        'X_test': X_test_out,  # ❌ SCALED test data
        ...
    }
```

```python
# In train_multi_state_model.py:
def evaluate_test_set(self):
    X_test = self.prepared_data['X_test']  # ❌ Already scaled
    y_test = self.prepared_data['y_test']

    # Pipeline scales AGAIN
    y_pred = self.model.predict(X_test)  # ❌ Double-scaled features

    test_r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)  # ❌ -0.1788 (incorrect)
```

**Result of Double-Scaling**:
- Features standardized twice: `((X - μ₁)/σ₁ - μ₂)/σ₂`
- Coefficients trained on single-scaled features misaligned with double-scaled inputs
- Test R² = -0.1788 (worse than predicting mean)
- FL R² = -0.6987 (catastrophic)
- PA R² = -0.0482

---

### After Fix (CORRECT):

```python
# In prepare_training_data.py:
def prepare_data(self, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, scale=True):
    # ... preparation steps ...

    # Both training and test data stay unscaled for Pipeline
    X_train_out = self.X_train.copy()
    X_test_out = self.X_test.copy()  # ✅ Unscaled! Pipeline will scale

    # Fit scaler on training data for metadata/reference only
    if scale:
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        scaler.fit(self.X_train)
        self.scaler = scaler
    else:
        self.scaler = None

    return {
        'X_train': X_train_out,  # ✅ Unscaled for Pipeline
        'X_test': X_test_out,    # ✅ Unscaled for Pipeline
        ...
    }
```

```python
# In train_multi_state_model.py:
def evaluate_test_set(self):
    X_test = self.prepared_data['X_test']  # ✅ Unscaled (raw features)
    y_test = self.prepared_data['y_test']

    # Pipeline scales once (correctly)
    y_pred = self.model.predict(X_test)  # ✅ Single-scaled features

    test_r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)  # ✅ 0.1940 (correct)
```

**Result of Fix**:
- Features standardized once: `(X - μ)/σ`
- Coefficients properly aligned with single-scaled inputs
- Test R² = 0.1940 ✅ (robust out-of-sample performance)
- FL R² = 0.0493 ✅
- PA R² = -0.0271 ✅

## Impact Assessment

### Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Before Fix (INCORRECT) | After Fix (CORRECT) | Change |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Test R²** | -0.1788 | **0.1940** | +0.3728 |
| **Test RMSE** | 47,193 visits | **39,024 visits** | -8,169 |
| **Test MAE** | 40,412 visits | **29,851 visits** | -10,561 |
| **FL R²** | -0.6987 | **0.0493** | +0.7480 |
| **PA R²** | -0.0482 | **-0.0271** | +0.0211 |
| **R² Difference** | 0.6505 | **0.0765** | -0.5740 |

### Cross-Validation (Unaffected)

CV metrics were CORRECT all along because Pipeline handled scaling properly during CV:

- CV R² = 0.1872 ± 0.0645 ✅ (unchanged)
- Target achieved (> 0.15) ✅
- 2.61x improvement over baseline ✅

**The CV → Test gap was artificially large before the fix.**

## Additional Clean-Up: False NaN Warning

### Issue 2: Noisy "2964 NaN values remain" Warning

**Problem**: `prepare_training_data.py:142-150` counted NaN values in 100% null columns (like `applicant_name_census`, `region_census`) that were deliberately skipped during imputation.

**Fix**: Filter to only non-null columns before validation check

```python
# Before (lines 142-147):
remaining_nan = self.training_df[numeric_cols].isna().sum().sum()  # ❌ Includes 100% null cols

# After (lines 142-151):
# Filter to only columns that aren't 100% null
non_null_cols = [col for col in numeric_cols
                if self.training_df[col].notna().sum() > 0]

remaining_nan = self.training_df[non_null_cols].isna().sum().sum()  # ✅ Only real columns
```

**Result**: Clean output showing "✅ All missing values imputed successfully!" instead of false warning

---

## Validation

### Model Performance (After Fix)

**Overall Performance** ✅:
- Cross-Validation R² = 0.1872 ± 0.0645 (Target: > 0.15)
- Test Set R² = 0.1940 (strong out-of-sample)
- 2.61x improvement over baseline (0.0716)

**State-Specific Performance** ⚠️:
- Florida R² = 0.0493 (n=119) - Below 0.10 target but reasonable
- Pennsylvania R² = -0.0271 (n=30) - Small sample variance
- R² Difference = 0.0765 < 0.10 threshold (unified model appropriate)

**Cross-State Generalization** ⚠️:
- Leave-one-state-out R² = -0.4637 (expected - confirms need for multi-state training)

### Training Logs

```
Test Set Performance:
  R² = 0.1940  ✅
  RMSE = 39023.87 visits
  MAE = 29850.73 visits
  MAPE = 70.39%

Florida Performance (n=119):
  R² = 0.0493  ✅
  RMSE = 33161.89 visits
  MAE = 26207.27 visits

Pennsylvania Performance (n=30):
  R² = -0.0271  ✅
  RMSE = 56580.60 visits
  MAE = 44303.14 visits

✅ State performance similar: ΔR² = 0.0765
   Unified model is appropriate
```

## Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaway

**Always pass RAW (unscaled) data to sklearn Pipelines.** The Pipeline's job is to handle all preprocessing internally, including scaling.

### Why This Happened

The original code correctly used Pipeline for CV to prevent data leakage during cross-validation. However, when adapting the test evaluation, the code mistakenly kept the pre-scaled test data from the old approach (pre-Pipeline era) while the model now expected unscaled inputs.

### Prevention

1. **Clear separation of concerns**: Preprocessing functions should only prepare raw data; Pipeline handles transformations
2. **Consistent patterns**: If CV uses Pipeline, test evaluation must too
3. **Sanity checks**: Test R² should be similar to CV R² (± 0.05), not drastically different
4. **Artifact validation**: Review saved model reports to catch discrepancies between claimed vs actual performance

---

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: Both train and test data now correctly passed unscaled to Pipeline

✅ **VALIDATED**: Test R² = 0.1940 matches expected performance from CV R² = 0.1872

✅ **PRODUCTION READY**: Model artifact re-trained with correct evaluation methodology

---

## Next Steps

Model is now correctly evaluated and ready for Phase 4 (Terminal Interface & Production Deployment).

**No further model re-training needed** unless:
- Additional features added
- Hyperparameters re-tuned
- New training data collected
