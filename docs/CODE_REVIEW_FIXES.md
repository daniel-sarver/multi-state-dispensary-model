# Code Review Fixes - Phase 1 Data Integration

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved
**Impact**: +98 training dispensaries recovered (15.2% improvement)

---

## Overview

Following a comprehensive code review by Codex, five critical issues were identified and resolved in the Phase 1 data integration pipeline. These fixes resulted in a **15.2% increase in training data** (from 643 to 741 dispensaries) and significantly improved code quality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hemp/CBD Filtering Over-Exclusion ✅

**Location**: `src/data_integration/create_combined_datasets.py:98-149`

**Problem**:
```python
# Old approach - too aggressive
hemp_cbd_keywords = ['hemp', 'cbd', 'kratom', 'smoke shop', 'tobacco',
                     'vape shop', 'wellness', 'nutrition', 'supplement']

name_filter = ~placer_df['Property Name'].str.lower().str.contains(
    '|'.join(hemp_cbd_keywords), na=False
)
```
- Keyword "wellness" removed legitimate dispensaries like "Surterra Wellness" and "Restore Wellness (Ayr)"
- Lost 82 FL + 30 PA rows before even attempting matching

**Solution**:
```python
# New approach - cannabis brand whitelist + smart filtering
cannabis_chains = [
    'trulieve', 'curaleaf', 'surterra', 'muv', 'vidacann', 'liberty',
    'fluent', 'growhealthy', 'rise', 'ayr', 'restore wellness',
    'sanctuary', 'cookies', 'insa', 'green dragon', 'jungle boys',
    'cannabist', 'columbia care'
]

# Keep if: (cannabis category AND (known cannabis brand OR not hemp/CBD flagged))
cannabis_only = placer_df[
    cannabis_criteria & (is_known_cannabis | ~potential_hemp_cbd)
].copy()
```

**Impact**:
- FL retention rate: 88.5% → 94.8% (+6.3%)
- PA retention rate: 84.1% → 91.0% (+6.9%)
- Legitimate dispensaries no longer incorrectly filtered

---

### 2. Address Matching Drops Valid Records ✅

**Location**: `src/data_integration/create_combined_datasets.py:217-355`

**Problem**:
```python
# Old approach - deleted regulator record after first match
if best_match is not None:
    matches.append(matched_record)
    regulator_df = regulator_df.drop(best_match.name)  # ❌ PROBLEM!
```
- 121 FL training rows stranded in unmatched file (e.g., Trulieve Pace/Destin/Gainesville)
- Even though addresses lined up, regulator records were deleted on first match
- Multiple Placer stores at similar addresses couldn't match to same regulator entry

**Solution**:
```python
# New approach - track matched indices, preserve records
matched_regulator_indices = set()

# During matching:
if best_match is not None:
    reg_idx, matched_reg_row = best_match
    matches.append(matched_record)
    matched_regulator_indices.add(reg_idx)  # ✅ Track, don't delete

# After all matching:
remaining_regulator_df = working_regulator_df[
    ~working_regulator_df.index.isin(matched_regulator_indices)
]
```

**Impact**:
- FL training dispensaries: 511 → 590 (+79, +15.5%)
- PA training dispensaries: 132 → 151 (+19, +14.4%)
- Flagship chains (Trulieve, MUV, etc.) now properly matched

---

### 3. Single-Factor Matching Insufficient ✅

**Location**: `src/data_integration/create_combined_datasets.py:187-215`

**Problem**:
```python
# Old approach - only street address compared
score = fuzz.ratio(placer_addr, reg_addr)
if score > best_score and score >= 85:
    best_match = reg_row
    best_score = score
```
- No city or ZIP consideration
- Hard to disambiguate similar addresses in different cities
- Lower confidence in matches

**Solution**:
```python
# New approach - composite scoring with multiple factors
def calculate_match_score(self, placer_row, reg_row, address_col):
    addr_score = fuzz.ratio(placer_addr, reg_addr)
    city_score = fuzz.ratio(placer_city, reg_city)
    zip_match = 100 if placer_zip == reg_zip else 0

    # Weighted composite: 60% address, 25% city, 15% ZIP
    composite_score = (addr_score * 0.60) + (city_score * 0.25) + (zip_match * 0.15)

    return {
        'composite': composite_score,
        'address': addr_score,
        'city': city_score,
        'zip': zip_match
    }
```

**Impact**:
- FL average match score: ~90 → 96.3 (+6.3 points)
- PA average match score: ~90 → 97.7 (+7.7 points)
- Better disambiguation of similar addresses
- Transparency via `match_details` field: `addr:95|city:100|zip:100`

---

### 4. Coordinate Validation Not Implemented ✅

**Location**: `src/data_integration/create_combined_datasets.py:357-396`

**Problem**:
```python
# Old code - state_bounds defined but NEVER USED
self.state_bounds = {
    'PA': {'lat_min': 39.5, 'lat_max': 42.5, 'lon_min': -80.5, 'lon_max': -74.5},
    'FL': {'lat_min': 24.5, 'lat_max': 31.0, 'lon_min': -87.5, 'lon_max': -80.0}
}
# ... but no validation code!
```
- Documentation claimed "coordinate boundary checks" but none existed
- Invalid coordinates could slip through

**Solution**:
```python
def validate_coordinates(self, df, state_code):
    """Validate that coordinates fall within expected state boundaries."""
    bounds = self.state_bounds[state_code]

    lat_valid = (has_coords['latitude'] >= bounds['lat_min']) & \
                (has_coords['latitude'] <= bounds['lat_max'])
    lon_valid = (has_coords['longitude'] >= bounds['lon_min']) & \
                (has_coords['longitude'] <= bounds['lon_max'])

    valid_coords = lat_valid & lon_valid

    if invalid_count > 0:
        # Clear invalid coordinates but keep record
        df.loc[has_coords[~valid_coords].index, ['latitude', 'longitude']] = None

    return df

# Called in processing pipeline:
matched_df = self.validate_coordinates(matched_df, state_code)
```

**Impact**:
- Automated validation now actually runs
- Invalid coordinates detected and cleared
- FL: Validated 590 coordinates within boundaries
- PA: Validated 151 coordinates within boundaries

### 5. Missing Dependencies & Tests ✅

**Location**: New files created

**Problem**:
- `fuzzywuzzy` imported but no `requirements.txt` to document dependencies
- No unit tests to prevent regression of fixed issues
- Future Claude iterations could reintroduce same bugs

**Solution**:

**Created `requirements.txt`**:
```
# Core data processing
pandas>=2.1.0,<3.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0

# Fuzzy string matching
fuzzywuzzy>=0.18.0
python-Levenshtein>=0.21.0

# Testing
pytest>=7.4.0,<8.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.1.0,<5.0.0
```

**Created `tests/test_data_integration.py`**:
- `TestCannabisFiltering`: Verify Surterra/Ayr not filtered
- `TestAddressMatching`: Prevent duplicate regulator matches
- `TestCoordinateValidation`: Check boundary enforcement
- `TestAddressStandardization`: Verify normalization logic

**Impact**:
- Dependencies now documented and version-pinned
- Automated tests prevent regression
- Future developers can run `pytest` to verify fixes

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Overly Aggressive Filtering**: Keyword-based exclusion without considering known brands
2. **Destructive Matching Logic**: Modifying source dataframe during iteration
3. **Incomplete Implementation**: Defining but not using validation logic
4. **Missing Safeguards**: No tests to catch regressions

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Whitelist + Blacklist**: Use known brands to override generic filters
2. **Non-Destructive Iteration**: Track indices, preserve source data
3. **Composite Scoring**: Multiple factors (address+city+ZIP) better than single factor
4. **Automated Validation**: Actually implement the checks you document
5. **Test Coverage**: Write tests for critical business logic

### Future Improvements

- Consider geocoding unmatched Placer records to auto-fill regulator data
- Implement review process for low-confidence matches (80-85 range)
- Add address parsing library (usaddress) for better standardization
- Create manual review UI for remaining unmatched records
- Build monitoring dashboard for data quality metrics

## Conclusion

All five issues identified in the code review have been successfully resolved. The data integration pipeline is now:

- ✅ **More Accurate**: 741 training dispensaries (+15.2% vs initial)
- ✅ **Better Tested**: Comprehensive test suite prevents regressions
- ✅ **Properly Documented**: requirements.txt and updated docs
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Automated validation and quality checks

**Next Step**: Phase 2 - Census Demographics Integration
