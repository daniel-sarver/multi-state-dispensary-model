# Within-State Prediction Analysis - Diagnostic Report

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Purpose**: Analyze why model performs poorly for within-state comparisons
**Context**: User needs to compare sites within FL and within PA (not across states)

---

## Executive Summary

The multi-state model's overall R² = 0.19 is **misleading** for within-state site selection. Diagnostic analysis reveals:

### Key Findings:
1. **Overall R² inflated by between-state differences** (PA median 67% higher than FL)
2. **Within-state predictive power is very weak**:
   - Florida: R² = 0.048 (best feature explains only 5.7% of variance)
   - Pennsylvania: R² = -0.028 (best feature explains only 12.8% of variance)
3. **Root cause**: Available features (demographics, competition, square footage) have almost no signal within individual states

### Recommendation:
**Current demographic/competitive data is insufficient for reliable within-state site ranking.** To improve within-state predictions, we need operational and local-context data that we currently don't have.

## Detailed Findings

### Florida Within-State Analysis (590 dispensaries)

**Top 10 Features by Predictive Power** (excluding data leakage columns):

| Feature | Correlation | R² | Variance Explained |
|---------|-------------|----|--------------------|
| competitors_5mi | -0.239 | 0.057 | **5.7%** |
| competitors_3mi | -0.213 | 0.045 | **4.5%** |
| competitors_1mi | -0.189 | 0.036 | **3.6%** |
| competitors_10mi | -0.182 | 0.033 | **3.3%** |
| sq_ft | 0.173 | 0.030 | **3.0%** |
| educated_urban_score | -0.160 | 0.026 | **2.6%** |
| saturation_5mi | -0.156 | 0.024 | **2.4%** |
| competitors_20mi | -0.146 | 0.021 | **2.1%** |
| competition_weighted_20mi | -0.134 | 0.018 | **1.8%** |
| pop_1mi | -0.130 | 0.017 | **1.7%** |

**Key Insight**: Even combining ALL these features in a Ridge model, we only achieve R² = 0.048 within Florida.

**Why so weak?**
- Mature, saturated market with 590 dispensaries
- Tourist population not captured in Census data
- Established brands dominate (not in our data)
- Product quality, staff, and operations vary widely (not in our data)

### Pennsylvania Within-State Analysis (151 dispensaries)

**Top 10 Features by Predictive Power** (excluding data leakage columns):

| Feature | Correlation | R² | Variance Explained |
|---------|-------------|----|--------------------|
| competitors_20mi | -0.358 | 0.128 | **12.8%** |
| competitors_10mi | -0.268 | 0.072 | **7.2%** |
| saturation_20mi | -0.241 | 0.058 | **5.8%** |
| pct_bachelor_plus | -0.224 | 0.050 | **5.0%** |
| affluent_market_5mi | -0.221 | 0.049 | **4.9%** |
| pop_20mi | -0.212 | 0.045 | **4.5%** |
| competition_weighted_20mi | -0.207 | 0.043 | **4.3%** |
| median_household_income | -0.207 | 0.043 | **4.3%** |
| per_capita_income | -0.200 | 0.040 | **4.0%** |
| sq_ft | 0.165 | 0.027 | **2.7%** |

**Key Insight**: PA features are slightly stronger than FL (12.8% vs 5.7% for top feature), but still very weak. Combined Ridge model achieves R² = -0.028 (negative = worse than random).

**Why negative R²?**
- Smaller training set (151 vs 590 FL sites)
- Medical market with different dynamics than FL recreational
- Model coefficients dominated by larger FL dataset
- Features that work cross-state don't work within-PA

---

## Why Overall R² = 0.19 is Misleading

### Between-State vs Within-State Variance

The model's overall R² = 0.19 comes primarily from **between-state differences**, not within-state predictive power.

**Breakdown of R² = 0.19:**
- **~70%** from between-state effect (PA median 67% higher than FL)
  - Simply knowing state = PA gives ~20k visit boost
- **~30%** from within-state effects
  - FL within-state: R² = 0.048
  - PA within-state: R² = -0.028

**Analogy**: Like predicting NBA player heights from position (guard vs center). Easy to predict centers are taller than guards (between-group), but hard to predict which guards are tallest (within-group).

---

## Why Current Features Have Weak Within-State Signal

### 1. Market Homogeneity Within States

**Demographics are similar within states:**
- FL dispensaries mostly in urban/suburban areas with similar demographics
- Census variables (income, age, education) have low variance within state
- Population density doesn't distinguish winners from losers

**Competition is everywhere:**
- FL has 590 dispensaries (highly saturated)
- Most FL sites have 3-10 competitors within 5mi
- Competition counts don't predict who wins the competitive battle

### 2. Missing Critical Success Factors

**Operational factors** (not in our data):
- Product quality and selection
- Staff knowledge and customer service
- Marketing effectiveness
- Loyalty programs
- Store layout and parking
- Hours of operation

**Location micro-factors** (not in our data):
- Visibility from road
- Co-location with retail anchors
- Ease of access and parking
- Local regulations and enforcement
- Proximity to medical providers (PA medical market)

**Temporal factors** (not in our data):
- Market entry timing
- Competitive entry after opening
- Brand reputation buildup
- Customer base development

### 3. Outcome Variance is High

**Florida standard deviation**: 18,725 annual visits
**Pennsylvania standard deviation**: 30,190 annual visits

This high variance suggests that:
- Many factors beyond demographics/competition drive success
- Operational excellence can overcome poor locations
- Poor operations can undermine good locations

## Should We Build Separate State Models?

### Analysis: Probably Not Worth It

**Potential benefit**: Remove between-state signal inflation, use state-specific coefficients

**Why unlikely to improve within-state R²:**

1. **Feature weakness is fundamental**: If competitors_5mi only explains 5.7% in FL, a separate FL-only model won't magically make it stronger

2. **PA has insufficient data**: Only 151 sites may be too small for reliable state-specific model

3. **We'd still be missing critical predictors**: Separate models can't create signal that doesn't exist in the data

### Recommendation: Test but Don't Expect Miracles

Let me create separate FL-only and PA-only models to empirically test if they improve within-state R². But based on feature diagnostics, I expect:

- **FL-only model**: R² = 0.05-0.10 (small improvement from 0.048)
- **PA-only model**: R² = 0.05-0.15 (may work better due to stronger competition signal)

---

## Alternative Modeling Approaches

### 1. Tree-Based Models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

**Potential benefit**: Capture non-linear relationships and interactions

**Likelihood of success**: **LOW**
- Tree models excel when there are complex interactions to learn
- But if features have no signal, trees can't create signal from noise
- May overfit given weak feature relationships

**Recommendation**: Worth a quick test, but don't expect dramatic improvement

---

### 2. Ensemble Methods

**Potential benefit**: Combine multiple weak learners

**Likelihood of success**: **LOW**
- Ensembles work when weak learners have some signal to aggregate
- Can't ensemble away fundamental data limitations

**Recommendation**: Skip unless tree models show promise

---

### 3. Feature Engineering Improvements

**Current features focus on**: Demographics, competition counts, square footage

**New features to try**:

| Feature Category | Specific Features | Data Source | Expected Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Competitive Positioning** | Market share estimates (sq_ft relative to competitors) | Existing data | MODERATE - may help FL |
| | Competitive density gradients | Existing data | LOW - competition already weak |
| | Nearest competitor distance | Existing data | MODERATE - better than counts |
| **Traffic/Access** | AADT (now collected!) | User input | MODERATE - proxy for visibility |
| | Intersection density | New (OSM data) | LOW-MODERATE |
| | Highway access | New (OSM data) | LOW-MODERATE |
| **Local Context** | Retail anchor density | New (POI data) | MODERATE |
| | Medical offices nearby (PA) | New (POI data) | MODERATE for PA |
| | Tourist attractions (FL) | New (POI data) | MODERATE for FL |

**Recommendation**: Pursue AADT integration first (we're already collecting it). Requires gathering AADT data for training set.

## What Would Actually Improve Within-State Predictions?

### Priority 1: Operational Data (HIGH IMPACT)

**If Insa can provide**:
- Product mix by category (flower, edibles, concentrates)
- Average transaction value
- Staff count and experience levels
- Marketing spend by channel
- Loyalty program enrollment

**Expected impact**: Could improve R² from 0.05 → 0.20-0.30

---

### Priority 2: Temporal Data (MODERATE-HIGH IMPACT)

**Approach**: Track dispensaries over time instead of snapshot
- Opening date and ramp-up trajectory
- Competitive entry timing
- Seasonal patterns
- Market maturity effects

**Expected impact**: Could improve R² from 0.05 → 0.15-0.25

---

### Priority 3: Location Micro-Factors (MODERATE IMPACT)

**Manual site visit data**:
- Parking spaces and accessibility
- Visibility rating from road
- Co-location with retail anchors (grocery, shopping centers)
- Building quality and signage

**Expected impact**: Could improve R² from 0.05 → 0.15-0.20

---

### Priority 4: AADT Traffic Data (LOW-MODERATE IMPACT)

**Approach**: Integrate AADT for all training sites (currently collecting for new predictions)

**Expected impact**: Could improve R² from 0.05 → 0.08-0.12

**Effort**: Moderate (need to gather 741 AADT values)

---

## Realistic Expectations

### With Current Data (Demographics + Competition Only)

**Florida**: R² = 0.05-0.10 (explains 5-10% of variance)
**Pennsylvania**: R² = 0.05-0.15 (explains 5-15% of variance)

**Translation**: Model predictions have ~±50-75% error within states

---

### With Enhanced Features (+ AADT, local context)

**Florida**: R² = 0.10-0.20 (explains 10-20% of variance)
**Pennsylvania**: R² = 0.15-0.25 (explains 15-25% of variance)

**Translation**: Model predictions have ~±40-60% error within states

---

### With Operational Data (+ product mix, staff, marketing)

**Florida**: R² = 0.25-0.40 (explains 25-40% of variance)
**Pennsylvania**: R² = 0.30-0.45 (explains 30-45% of variance)

**Translation**: Model predictions have ~±30-40% error within states

---

## Immediate Recommendations

### Option A: Accept Current Limitations (Quick)

**Action**: Update documentation to clearly state model is for cross-state comparison only, not within-state ranking

**Use case**: If comparing sites across FL and PA, use current model

**Investment**: None

---

### Option B: Build Separate State Models (1-2 days)

**Action**:
1. Train FL-only Ridge model on 590 FL dispensaries
2. Train PA-only Ridge model on 151 PA dispensaries
3. Compare within-state R² to current model
4. Test alternative algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost)

**Expected outcome**: Small improvement (R² +0.02 to +0.05), may not be worth effort

**Investment**: 1-2 days development + testing

---

### Option C: Feature Enhancement - AADT Integration (1-2 weeks)

**Action**:
1. Gather AADT data for all 741 training dispensaries
2. Add AADT as feature in model
3. Retrain and evaluate within-state improvement

**Expected outcome**: Moderate improvement (R² +0.03 to +0.07)

**Investment**: 1-2 weeks (data gathering intensive)

---

### Option D: Operational Data Integration (4-8 weeks)

**Action**:
1. Collect Insa operational data (product mix, staff, marketing)
2. Add as features in model
3. Retrain and validate

**Expected outcome**: Major improvement (R² +0.15 to +0.30)

**Investment**: 4-8 weeks (requires Insa data access and integration)

---

## My Recommendation: Option B First, Then Assess

**Step 1** (1-2 days): Build separate state models to empirically test if they improve within-state R²

**Rationale**:
- Low investment, quick to test
- Will definitively answer "is multi-state model the problem?"
- If R² improves significantly → use separate models
- If R² stays weak → confirms feature limitation, not model architecture

**Step 2** (based on results):
- **If Step 1 shows improvement**: Deploy separate state models, consider AADT integration
- **If Step 1 shows no improvement**: Focus on operational data collection or accept current limitations

---

## Next Steps

I can proceed with building and testing separate state models now. This will take ~30 minutes and will give us empirical evidence on whether separate models help.

**Do you want me to**:
1. ✅ Build FL-only and PA-only Ridge models
2. ✅ Test alternative algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) on each state
3. ✅ Compare within-state R² values
4. ✅ Generate detailed performance report

Or would you prefer to:
- Discuss these findings first before proceeding
- Pursue a different option (C or D)
- Accept current limitations (Option A)

## Technical Appendix

### Data Leakage Check: VERIFIED CLEAN ✅

The model training code (`src/modeling/prepare_training_data.py:231-238`) properly excludes data leakage features:

```python
'visits_per_sq_ft',  # Exclude UNCORRECTED derived variable (legacy)
'corrected_visits_per_sq_ft',  # Exclude derived target variable
'corrected_visits_step1',  # Exclude intermediate correction step
```

No data leakage in current model.
