Continue work on Multi-State Dispensary Model.

Project Directory: /Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model

Recent completion (Oct 28, 2025):
- ✅ Confidence interval improvements implemented (v2.1)
- ✅ Prediction-proportional RMSE scaling with ±75% cap
- ✅ Transparent cap notifications in all outputs
- ✅ Reduced interval width from 222% → 150% of prediction
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to git

Current Status:
- Model v2.1 trained and deployed (R² = 0.1812, improved CIs)
- CLI fully functional with business-friendly confidence intervals
- Multi-site analysis and report generation working
- Census tract auto-fetching operational for all PA/FL locations

Next Focus - DATA VALIDATION & UX ENHANCEMENTS:

Tasks:
1. Confirm market median uses corrected_visits (not Placer visits)
   - Verify all reports use corrected_visits consistently
   - Check for any mixing of corrected_visits vs placer_visits
   - Document where each is used

2. Add address input to CLI workflow
   - Allow optional address entry for each site
   - Display address in reports for easier identification
   - Coordinates still required for calculations
   - Address is for comprehension/labeling only

3. Add AADT input to CLI workflow
   - Allow optional AADT (Average Annual Daily Traffic) entry
   - Include in reports as supplementary metric
   - AADT = total traffic of roads adjacent to site
   - Optional field (can be skipped)

Let's start by examining how market median is calculated and where corrected_visits vs placer_visits are used.
