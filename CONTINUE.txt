✅ DATA VALIDATION & UX ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETE
- ✅ Fixed market median benchmarks - now calculated from corrected_visits
  - FL median corrected: 55k → 31.1k (was 76% too high)
  - PA median corrected: 65k → 52.1k (was 25% too high)
- ✅ Confirmed all reports use corrected_visits consistently
- ✅ Added optional address input to CLI workflow
- ✅ Added optional AADT (traffic) input to CLI workflow
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to git (commit 2273a20)

Previous completion (Oct 28, 2025):
- ✅ Confidence interval improvements implemented (v2.1)
- ✅ Prediction-proportional RMSE scaling with ±75% cap
- ✅ Transparent cap notifications in all outputs
- ✅ Reduced interval width from 222% → 150% of prediction

Current Status:
- Model v2.1 trained and deployed (R² = 0.1812, improved CIs)
- CLI fully functional with business-friendly confidence intervals
- Multi-site analysis and report generation working
- Census tract auto-fetching operational for all PA/FL locations
- Market benchmarks accurate (calculated from corrected_visits)
- Address and AADT inputs available for better site identification

System Ready For:
- Production use for PA & FL site analysis
- Client presentations with accurate benchmarks
- Multi-site comparisons with enhanced identification
- Professional reports with address/AADT context
