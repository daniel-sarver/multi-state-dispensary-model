Continue work on Multi-State Dispensary Model.

Project Directory: /Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model

Recent completion (Oct 28, 2025 - Latest):
✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXES (commit 2f7bfdc)
- ✅ Fixed HIGH priority: address/AADT dropped in interactive mode
  - Was collected but never reached reports/summaries
  - Now flows through: input → coords → results → reports
- ✅ Fixed MEDIUM priority: address/lat/lon/AADT omitted in batch mode
  - Input CSV fields were completely ignored
  - Now preserved in output predictions CSV
- ✅ All fixes tested and verified (unit tests passing)
- Issues identified by Codex code review

✅ DATA VALIDATION & UX ENHANCEMENTS (commits 2273a20, 1b14c7a)
- ✅ Fixed market median benchmarks - now calculated from corrected_visits
  - FL median corrected: 55k → 31.1k (was 76% too high)
  - PA median corrected: 65k → 52.1k (was 25% too high)
- ✅ Confirmed all reports use corrected_visits consistently
- ✅ Added optional address input to CLI workflow
- ✅ Added optional AADT (traffic) input to CLI workflow

Previous completion (Oct 28, 2025):
- ✅ Confidence interval improvements implemented (v2.1)
- ✅ Prediction-proportional RMSE scaling with ±75% cap
- ✅ Transparent cap notifications in all outputs
- ✅ Reduced interval width from 222% → 150% of prediction

Current Status:
- Model v2.1 trained and deployed (R² = 0.1812, improved CIs)
- CLI fully functional with business-friendly confidence intervals
- Multi-site analysis and report generation working
- Census tract auto-fetching operational for all PA/FL locations
- Market benchmarks accurate (calculated from corrected_visits)
- Address and AADT inputs available for better site identification

System Ready For:
- Production use for PA & FL site analysis
- Client presentations with accurate benchmarks
- Multi-site comparisons with enhanced identification
- Professional reports with address/AADT context
