Continue work on Multi-State Dispensary Model.

Project Directory: /Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DISCOVERY (Oct 28, 2025 - LATEST):
âœ… WITHIN-STATE PREDICTION ANALYSIS COMPLETE
- âœ… Diagnostic analysis reveals model v2 overall RÂ²=0.19 is MISLEADING
- âœ… Overall RÂ² inflated by between-state differences (PA median 67% higher than FL)
- âœ… Within-state predictive power is VERY WEAK:
  - Florida: RÂ² = 0.048 (best feature explains only 5.7% of variance)
  - Pennsylvania: RÂ² = -0.028 (worse than random guessing)
- âœ… Root cause: Available features (demographics, competition) have almost no signal within states
- âœ… Full diagnostic report: docs/WITHIN_STATE_PREDICTION_ANALYSIS.md

KEY INSIGHT:
User needs to compare sites WITHIN states (FL vs FL, PA vs PA), not ACROSS states.
Current model is optimized for wrong use case!

NEXT TASK: Build State-Specific Models (v3.0)
ðŸ“‹ Planned approach:
1. Train separate FL-only and PA-only Ridge models
2. Test 5 feature combinations per state (competition-focused, demographics-focused, etc.)
3. Test alternative algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) on best feature sets
4. Compare within-state RÂ² improvement vs current v2 model
5. Update CLI to route to correct state model automatically (zero user impact)

Estimated time: 2 hours for thorough feature selection testing

Previous completion (Oct 28, 2025):
âœ… CRITICAL BUG FIXES (commit 2f7bfdc)
- Fixed HIGH priority: address/AADT dropped in interactive mode
- Fixed MEDIUM priority: address/lat/lon/AADT omitted in batch mode
- All fixes tested and verified (unit tests passing)

âœ… DATA VALIDATION & UX ENHANCEMENTS (commits 2273a20, 1b14c7a)
- Fixed market median benchmarks - now calculated from corrected_visits
  - FL median corrected: 55k â†’ 31.1k (was 76% too high)
  - PA median corrected: 65k â†’ 52.1k (was 25% too high)
- Added optional address and AADT input to CLI workflow

âœ… CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IMPROVEMENTS (v2.1)
- Prediction-proportional RMSE scaling with Â±75% cap
- Reduced interval width from 222% â†’ 150% of prediction

Current Status:
- Model v2.1 trained but NOT SUITABLE for within-state comparisons
- CLI fully functional (will work unchanged with v3 state-specific models)
- Diagnostic analysis complete with feature correlation reports
- Analysis output: analysis_output/state_diagnostics/
