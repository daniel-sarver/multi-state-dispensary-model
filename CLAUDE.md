# CLAUDE.md - Multi-State Dispensary Model Project Guidelines

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL PROJECT PRINCIPLES

### **Data Integrity - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **NEVER USE SYNTHETIC DATA** without explicit approval from Daniel
- **NEVER** use geocoding estimates - require actual coordinates
- **ALWAYS** use verified real data from legitimate sources (Census, DOT, Placer.ai, etc.)
- **IF REAL DATA IS UNAVAILABLE** - Ask for explicit approval before using ANY estimates

### **Focus on Requested Changes Only**
- Change only what is specifically requested
- Don't "improve" working functionality unless asked
- Ask before making changes outside the specific request
- Build incrementally, testing each component before moving to the next

## Data Sources & Standards

### **Verified Data Sources**
- **Placer Data**: Visit estimates, coordinates, square footage (~750 dispensaries)
- **Census Data**: Demographics by tract (PA & FL)
- **State Regulator Data**: Complete licensing and competitive data
- **Insa Performance**: Actual visit data from FL, MA, CT stores
- **Traffic Data**: AADT where available by state

### **Data Quality Requirements**
- All coordinates verified within state boundaries
- No synthetic estimates without explicit approval
- Comprehensive validation at each processing step
- Clear documentation of all transformations
- Backup of original data before any processing

## Development Guidelines

### **Code Quality Standards**
- Follow existing PA model patterns for consistency
- Use descriptive variable names with snake_case
- Include docstrings with clear parameter descriptions
- Add try-catch blocks for external data operations
- Print progress updates for long-running operations

### **File Management**
- Use descriptive names: `multi_state_dispensaries.csv` not `output.csv`
- Version important files with dates when updated
- Document schema and source for all datasets
- Keep original files in `data/raw/` untouched
- Store processed files in `data/processed/`

### **Testing Approach**
- Start with small datasets before full processing
- Validate outputs make logical business sense
- Compare results against PA model patterns
- Cross-validate between PA and FL data
- Document any unexpected findings

- **Secondary**: Cross-state insights and universal success factors
- **Validation**: Performance benchmarking against Insa actual stores
- **Application**: PA & FL site selection and portfolio optimization

### **Success Metrics**
- **Statistical**: Target RÂ² > 0.15 (major improvement over 0.0716)
- **Business**: Accurate site ranking and risk assessment
- **Validation**: Strong correlation with Insa actual performance
- **Usability**: Clean terminal interface matching PA model standards

## Recent Enhancements (October 2025)

### **On-the-Fly Census Tract Fetching**
- System automatically fetches missing census tracts from Census API
- Handles all PA/FL locations (not just pre-loaded tracts)
- Safe handling of None values when Census data incomplete
- Cached for performance
- See: `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_CENSUS_TRACT_FIX.md`

### **Extreme Value Warning System**
- Validates features against training data ranges
- Prompts user for approval when values extreme
- Distinguishes between extreme (requires approval) and out-of-range (informational)
- Batch mode flags sites with warnings in output CSV
- Transparent about prediction reliability

### **Confidence Interval Improvements (v2.1)**
- Prediction-proportional RMSE scaling (smaller predictions = narrower intervals)
- Â±75% cap for business usability (prevents unusably wide intervals)
- Transparent cap notifications in all outputs (HTML/CSV/TXT/CLI)
- Reduced interval width from 222% â†’ 150% of prediction
- Lower bounds now meaningful (12k vs 0 for 50k prediction)
- See: `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_CI_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### **State-Specific Models v3.0** (October 28, 2025)
- Separate models for FL and PA optimized for within-state predictions
- Florida: Ridge Regression (RÂ² = 0.0685, +42.8% improvement)
- Pennsylvania: Random Forest (RÂ² = 0.0756, from negative to positive!)
- Automatic state routing based on location (zero user impact)
- Both states now usable for comparative ranking
- See: `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_STATE_SPECIFIC_V3.md`

### **Report System v3.0** (October 29, 2025)
- All reports updated to v3.0 version numbering
- Site performance scoring (1-5 scale) matching PA model format
  - 5.0: Exceptional (Top 10%), 4.0: Above Average (70-90th percentile)
  - 3.0: Average (30-70th percentile), 2.0: Below Average (10-30th percentile)
  - 1.0: Poor (Bottom 10%)
- Color-coded circular score badges in HTML reports
- Enhanced footer with state-specific performance metrics and guidance
- CSV properly sorted by rank
- See: `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_29_REPORT_V3_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
