# CLAUDE.md - Multi-State Dispensary Model Project Guidelines

## ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL PROJECT PRINCIPLES

### **Data Integrity - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **NEVER USE SYNTHETIC DATA** without explicit approval from Daniel
- **NEVER** use geocoding estimates - require actual coordinates
- **ALWAYS** use verified real data from legitimate sources (Census, DOT, Placer.ai, etc.)
- **IF REAL DATA IS UNAVAILABLE** - Ask for explicit approval before using ANY estimates

### **Focus on Requested Changes Only**
- Change only what is specifically requested
- Don't "improve" working functionality unless asked
- Ask before making changes outside the specific request
- Build incrementally, testing each component before moving to the next

- **Training Data**: 741 dispensaries across PA & FL
- **Interface**: Complete terminal CLI with report generation and multi-site analysis
- **Key Features**:
  - Coordinate-based input (3-4 inputs vs 23 manual features)
  - Multi-site analysis (up to 5 sites per session)
  - Professional report generation (HTML/CSV/TXT/JSON)
  - State-specific branding and benchmarks

---

## Core System Architecture

### **Data Integration Pipeline**
- Placer data consolidation for PA & FL (~750 dispensaries)
- Census demographics integration at tract level
- State regulator data for complete competitive landscape
- Insa actual performance data for validation benchmark

### **Enhanced Feature Engineering**
- Multi-radius population analysis (1mi, 3mi, 5mi, 10mi)
- Distance-weighted competition metrics
- Market saturation indicators (dispensaries per capita)
- Demographic profiles (age, income, education)
- State-specific factors and multipliers
- Traffic/accessibility data where available

### **Model Development**
- Enhanced Ridge regression with state interaction terms
- Ensemble methods testing for improved performance
- Geographic cross-validation with state-based splits
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Validation against Insa actual performance

---

## Data Sources & Standards

### **Verified Data Sources**
- **Placer Data**: Visit estimates, coordinates, square footage (~750 dispensaries)
- **Census Data**: Demographics by tract (PA & FL)
- **State Regulator Data**: Complete licensing and competitive data
- **Insa Performance**: Actual visit data from FL, MA, CT stores
- **Traffic Data**: AADT where available by state

### **Data Quality Requirements**
- All coordinates verified within state boundaries
- No synthetic estimates without explicit approval
- Comprehensive validation at each processing step
- Clear documentation of all transformations
- Backup of original data before any processing

---

## Development Guidelines

### **Code Quality Standards**
- Follow existing PA model patterns for consistency
- Use descriptive variable names with snake_case
- Include docstrings with clear parameter descriptions
- Add try-catch blocks for external data operations
- Print progress updates for long-running operations

### **File Management**
- Use descriptive names: `multi_state_dispensaries.csv` not `output.csv`
- Version important files with dates when updated
- Document schema and source for all datasets
- Keep original files in `data/raw/` untouched
- Store processed files in `data/processed/`

### **Testing Approach**
- Start with small datasets before full processing
- Validate outputs make logical business sense
- Compare results against PA model patterns
- Cross-validate between PA and FL data
- Document any unexpected findings

---

## Business Context

### **Multi-State Modeling Goals**
- **Primary**: Significantly improved predictive power through larger dataset
- **Secondary**: Cross-state insights and universal success factors
- **Validation**: Performance benchmarking against Insa actual stores
- **Application**: PA & FL site selection and portfolio optimization

### **Success Metrics**
- **Statistical**: Target RÂ² > 0.15 (major improvement over 0.0716)
- **Business**: Accurate site ranking and risk assessment
- **Validation**: Strong correlation with Insa actual performance
- **Usability**: Clean terminal interface matching PA model standards

## Recent Enhancements (October 2025)

### **On-the-Fly Census Tract Fetching**
- System automatically fetches missing census tracts from Census API
- Handles all PA/FL locations (not just pre-loaded tracts)
- Safe handling of None values when Census data incomplete
- Cached for performance
- See: `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_CENSUS_TRACT_FIX.md`

### **Extreme Value Warning System**
- Validates features against training data ranges
- Prompts user for approval when values extreme
- Distinguishes between extreme (requires approval) and out-of-range (informational)
- Batch mode flags sites with warnings in output CSV
- Transparent about prediction reliability
