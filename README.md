# Multi-State Dispensary Prediction Model

**Enhanced dispensary visit prediction model for Pennsylvania and Florida**

Building on the proven PA Dispensary Model foundation to create a more powerful multi-state prediction system with improved accuracy through larger training datasets and enhanced feature engineering.

## Project Overview

This project enhances the successful PA Dispensary Model (v3.1) by:
