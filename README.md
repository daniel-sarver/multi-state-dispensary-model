# Multi-State Dispensary Prediction Model

**Enhanced dispensary visit prediction model for Pennsylvania and Florida**

Building on the proven PA Dispensary Model foundation to create a more powerful multi-state prediction system with improved accuracy through larger training datasets and enhanced feature engineering.

## Project Overview

This project enhances the successful PA Dispensary Model (v3.1) by:
- Training on larger multi-state dataset (~750 dispensaries vs 150-600 single state)
- Integrating FL and PA data with state-specific multipliers
- Enhanced feature engineering for population, competition, and accessibility
- Maintaining proven interface and reporting standards

## Quick Start

**Status**: Phase 3b (Model Training) - Competitive Features Complete, Ready for Model Development

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd multi-state-dispensary-model

# Set up environment (first time only)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Census API key

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify dataset ready for modeling
python3 -c "import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('data/processed/combined_with_competitive_features.csv'); print(f'Training dispensaries: {df[df.has_placer_data==True].shape[0]}')"

# Next: Build Ridge regression model (Phase 3b)
# Coming soon: python3 src/modeling/train_multi_state_model.py
```

## Model Architecture

**Target Performance**: Significantly improved R² over PA model's 0.0716
**Training Data**: ~750 dispensaries across PA & FL
**Features**: Multi-radius population, distance-weighted competition, demographics, state factors
**Model Type**: Enhanced Ridge regression with state interaction terms

## Data Sources

- **Placer Data**: Visit estimates, square footage, coordinates (741 training dispensaries)
- **Census Bureau API**: Demographics by tract via ACS 5-Year (2023)
  - Multi-radius population (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 mile buffers)
  - Age, income, education, population density
- **State Regulator Data**: Complete competitive landscape (937 dispensaries)
- **Insa Performance Data**: Validation benchmark from actual stores
- **Traffic Data**: AADT where available by state (planned)

## Development Principles

1. **Data Integrity**: Only verified real data sources, no synthetic estimates
2. **Simplicity**: Build on proven PA model patterns and interface design
3. **Organization**: GitHub best practices with comprehensive testing
4. **Learning**: Continuous documentation of key findings and insights

## Model Performance Goals

- **Statistical**: Target R² > 0.15 through enhanced dataset and features
- **Business**: Reliable site ranking and risk assessment for PA/FL expansion
- **Validation**: Cross-state validation and Insa performance benchmarking
- **Confidence**: Proper uncertainty quantification for business decisions

## Project Status

### Phase 1: Data Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ 741 training-eligible dispensaries (98.8% of target)
- ✅ 937 total dispensaries for competitive landscape
- ✅ Enhanced address matching (96-98 avg confidence)
- ✅ Cannabis-only filtering with brand whitelist
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite

### Phase 2: Census Demographics Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ 24 census features added (100% coverage)
- ✅ Multi-radius populations (1, 3, 5, 10, 20 miles)
- ✅ Demographics (age, income, education, density)
- ✅ Area-weighted population calculations
- ✅ 99.96% data completeness (7,730 unique tracts)

### Phase 3a: Competitive Features Engineering ✅ COMPLETE
