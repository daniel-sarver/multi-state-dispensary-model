# Multi-State Dispensary Prediction Model

**Enhanced dispensary visit prediction model for Pennsylvania and Florida**

Building on the proven PA Dispensary Model foundation to create a more powerful multi-state prediction system with improved accuracy through larger training datasets and enhanced feature engineering.

## Project Overview

This project enhances the successful PA Dispensary Model (v3.1) by:
- Training on larger multi-state dataset (~750 dispensaries vs 150-600 single state)
- Integrating FL and PA data with state-specific multipliers
- Enhanced feature engineering for population, competition, and accessibility
- Maintaining proven interface and reporting standards
