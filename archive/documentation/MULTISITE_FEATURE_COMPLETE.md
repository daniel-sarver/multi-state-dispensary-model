## Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

**1. `src/terminal/cli.py`**

**Changes Made**:
- Renamed `run_single_site_analysis()` functionality
- Added loop to collect up to 5 sites
- Added `all_results` list to store site data
- Added site counting and prompts
- Added error handling with retry options
- Added `_print_multi_site_summary()` method
- Updated menu text: "Site Analysis (Interactive - up to 5 sites)"

**Key Methods**:
```python
def run_single_site_analysis(self):
    """Interactive multi-site prediction with automatic feature calculation."""
    all_results = []
    site_count = 1
    max_sites = 5

    while site_count <= max_sites:
        # Get site details
        # Analyze site
        # Store results
        # Prompt for another site

    # Display comparison summary
    self._print_multi_site_summary(all_results)

    # Generate reports for all sites
```

```python
def _print_multi_site_summary(self, results: List[Dict[str, Any]]):
    """Print comparison summary for multiple sites."""
    # Sort by predicted visits
    # Display rankings table
    # Show statistics
    # Highlight best site
```

### Workflow Changes

**Before**:
```
User Input → Analysis → Display → Report (optional) → Exit
```

**After**:
```
Loop (up to 5 times):
    User Input → Analysis → Quick Summary → Prompt to continue

Multi-Site Summary (all sites ranked)
Report Generation (all sites in one report)
```

## Comparison to PA Model

### What Stayed the Same ✅
- Coordinate-based input (simplified 3-4 inputs)
- Automatic feature calculation
- Report structure and styling
- Professional HTML/CSV/TXT outputs

### What's New ✨
- **Multi-site entry in single session** (up to 5)
- **Interactive prompts to add more sites**
- **Multi-site comparison summary**
- **Ranked results display**
- **Statistics across all sites**
- **Best site highlighting**
- **All sites in one comprehensive report**

---

## Limitations & Notes

**Maximum Sites**: 5 per session
- Rationale: Keeps sessions manageable
- Prevents overwhelming reports
- Can run multiple sessions if needed

**Site Numbering**: Preserved from entry order
- Site 1 = first entered
- Ranking is separate from site number
- Reports show both site number and rank

**Error Recovery**: Robust handling
- Failed sites are skipped
- Session continues
- User can add replacement sites

   - See quick summary
   - Decide if adding another

3. **Review comparison summary**:
   - See all sites ranked
   - View statistics
   - Note best performer

4. **Generate reports** (optional):
   - Choose 'y' for comprehensive reports
