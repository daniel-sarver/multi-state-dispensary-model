Continue work on Multi-State Dispensary Model.

Project Directory: /Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model

âœ… STATE-SPECIFIC MODELS V3.0 DEPLOYED (Oct 28, 2025 - LATEST):
- âœ… Built and deployed separate FL and PA models optimized for within-state comparisons
- âœ… Florida model: Ridge with 31 features (CV RÂ² = 0.0685, +42.8% improvement)
- âœ… Pennsylvania model: Random Forest with 31 features (CV RÂ² = 0.0756, +1036 basis points!)
- âœ… Predictor updated with automatic state routing (zero user impact)
- âœ… CLI updated to use state-specific models seamlessly
- âœ… Comprehensive testing and documentation complete
- ðŸ“‹ Full details: docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_STATE_SPECIFIC_V3.md

DEPLOYMENT STATUS: Production Ready âœ…
- v3 models operational for within-state predictions
- Automatic routing: FL â†’ fl_model_v3.pkl, PA â†’ pa_model_v3.pkl
- User workflow unchanged (state â†’ coordinates â†’ sq_ft â†’ optional address/AADT)
- Backward compatibility maintained (v2 still available)

Previous completion (Oct 28, 2025):
âœ… CRITICAL BUG FIXES (commit 2f7bfdc)
- Fixed HIGH priority: address/AADT dropped in interactive mode
- Fixed MEDIUM priority: address/lat/lon/AADT omitted in batch mode
- All fixes tested and verified (unit tests passing)

âœ… DATA VALIDATION & UX ENHANCEMENTS (commits 2273a20, 1b14c7a)
- Fixed market median benchmarks - now calculated from corrected_visits
  - FL median corrected: 55k â†’ 31.1k (was 76% too high)
  - PA median corrected: 65k â†’ 52.1k (was 25% too high)
- Added optional address and AADT input to CLI workflow

âœ… CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IMPROVEMENTS (v2.1)
- Prediction-proportional RMSE scaling with Â±75% cap
- Reduced interval width from 222% â†’ 150% of prediction

Current Status:
- Model v3.0 deployed with state-specific models for within-state comparisons
- CLI fully functional and automatically routes to correct state model
- Significant improvement: FL +42.8%, PA from negative to positive RÂ²
- Analysis output: analysis_output/state_models_v3/

Reference Documents:
- docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_STATE_SPECIFIC_V3.md - V3 implementation details (LATEST)
- docs/WITHIN_STATE_PREDICTION_ANALYSIS.md - Diagnostic analysis that motivated v3
- docs/MODEL_PERFORMANCE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md - Model performance summary (needs v3 update)
- CLAUDE.md - Project guidelines and context

âœ… CODEX REVIEW COMPLETED (Oct 28, 2025):
- âœ… Fixed Issue 1: KeyError when PA model (Random Forest) accessed Ridge-specific code
- âœ… Fixed Issue 2: CLI displaying importances (0-1 scale) as visit deltas (misleading "+0 visits")
- âœ… Both FL and PA models now work correctly with appropriate display formatting
- ðŸ“‹ Full details: docs/CODEX_REVIEW_FIX_2025_10_28.md

NEXT STEPS (After Compact):
1. Review and update all project documentation (MODEL_PERFORMANCE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md, README, etc.)
2. Organize project directory (archive old files, clean up structure)
3. Commit all changes to Git with comprehensive commit message
4. Final testing: Run CLI end-to-end for both FL and PA predictions

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Optional):
- AADT Integration (1-2 weeks, RÂ² +0.03 to +0.07)
- Operational Data Collection (4-8 weeks, RÂ² +0.15 to +0.30)
- SHAP values for site-specific Random Forest explanations
