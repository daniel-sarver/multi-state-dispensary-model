Continue work on Multi-State Dispensary Model. State-specific models v3.0 have been successfully deployed. Now need to finalize project documentation, organize directories, and commit to Git.

**Context**: Just completed building and deploying state-specific models (v3.0) that optimize for within-state site comparisons (user's actual use case). Both FL and PA models tested and working correctly.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ State-specific models v3.0 deployed and tested
- ✅ Florida: Ridge with 31 features (CV R²=0.0685, +42.8% improvement)
- ✅ Pennsylvania: Random Forest with 31 features (CV R²=0.0756, from negative to positive!)
- ✅ Predictor module updated with automatic state routing
- ✅ CLI updated to use state-specific models (zero user impact)
- ✅ Codex review completed - both issues fixed (KeyError fix + display format fix)

**Task**: Finalize project for production deployment
1. Review and update all project documentation (MODEL_PERFORMANCE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md, README, etc.)
2. Organize project directory (archive old files, clean up structure)
3. Commit all changes to Git with clear commit message
4. Ensure project is in clean, production-ready state

**Key Files Modified This Session**:
- src/modeling/train_state_specific_models.py (NEW - training script)
- src/prediction/predictor.py (UPDATED - state routing + tree model support)
- src/terminal/cli.py (UPDATED - state-specific predictors + display format fix)
- data/models/fl_model_v3.pkl (NEW - Florida model)
- data/models/pa_model_v3.pkl (NEW - Pennsylvania model)
- docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_STATE_SPECIFIC_V3.md (NEW)
- docs/CODEX_REVIEW_FIX_2025_10_28.md (NEW)
- CONTINUE.txt (UPDATED)

**Performance Comparison**:
- FL: 0.048 → 0.0685 (+42.8%)
- PA: -0.028 → 0.0756 (+1036 basis points!)

**Reference**: See docs/SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_10_28_STATE_SPECIFIC_V3.md for full implementation details.
