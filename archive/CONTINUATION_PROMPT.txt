Let's continue work on the Multi-State Dispensary Model project.

We're starting the model improvement phase to boost predictive power from R² = 0.19 to 0.30+.

Navigate to: /Users/daniel_insa/Claude/multi-state-dispensary-model

Please read:
1. docs/MODEL_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md - Full improvement roadmap with Codex recommendations
2. docs/CONTINUATION_PROMPT_MODEL_IMPROVEMENT.md - Quick-start guide

Priority tasks:
1. PA temporal adjustments (annualize visits for sites < 12 months old, time-weight competition)
2. Brand effects with target encoding (Codex-recommended regularized approach)
3. Digital footprint features (Google/Yelp reviews - low-effort, high-value)

Expected improvement: +0.10 to +0.15 R² overall, PA from -0.03 to +0.12-0.15

Current baseline: Overall R² = 0.194, FL R² = 0.049, PA R² = -0.027
